\section{ Creating Feature Flags }

Feature flags are an important part of Angular Architecture. What it means is,
that a feature can be hidden, disabled, change code flow \footnote{Changing code flow means having an if statement turned off for instance}
or have routing being prevented from going to component.

\subsection{ Why are Feature Flags Important? }
Feature flags are important, because they can allow the UI Engineering team to
work independently from the back end and Automation/QA engineering. Some sample
situations to illustrate this point:

\mybox{ Product asks for a new cc + bcc field to be added to the email client.
We do not have the backend available yet, but would like to integrate it with the
backend at a later date it is ready. Sure, we can put the UI on hold until back
end is ready. However, what we can do, is test and hide ahead of time from the
UI side of things. We can then hide the feature and integrate with backend
when the time is right. }
