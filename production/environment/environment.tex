\section{ Environment }

When getting ready for production, it is important that you have different
environment files for dev and prod. Luckily the CLI will offer two different
environment files out the box. So, it should be immediately inherit to any
developer experienced, or otherwise, that it is something that should be payed
attention to. However, the full scope(gamut if you will) might not be
immediately inherit, wherein certain elements migth not be looked into
appropriately.
