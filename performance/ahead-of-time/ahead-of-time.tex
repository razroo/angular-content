\chapter{ Ahead Of Time Compilation }
Angular as a framework uses Typescript. In addition, it uses directives, components, 
\lstinline{@Input()}'s and \lstinline{@Output}'s. So, when one thinks about it, you

controlled, as that is handled by the internals of the framework. However, the 
real question that we should be asking ourselves, is when does this happen.
