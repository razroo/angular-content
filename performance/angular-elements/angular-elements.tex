\chapter{Angular Elements Load TIme}
Angular elements will include by default the Angular framework. As a result the bundle size will be somewhere around 60kb. This is one of the common complaints of Angular-elements. First and foremost, it is important to realize why it is that Angualr Elements is this size. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item This size is large as a result of Angular being bundled within the general custom web elements.
  \item With the way that Angular Ivy deals with bundling, this will be greatly diminished as time goes on.
  \item When defering script, even though it ends up getting loaded, with a proper load stategy, it does not affect performance. In fact, if built right, with a proper Angular Elements strategy, it can be just as effective as lazy loaded elements.
\begin{verbatim}
<script defer src="elements.js">
\end{verbatim}
