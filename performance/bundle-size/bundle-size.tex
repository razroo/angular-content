\section{Bundle Size}
\maketitle{}

Bundle sizes ironically, are one of those things that tend to get overlooked. 
It's ironic, because it can make such a large difference to a user, using the
app for the first time, while simaltaneously being one of the easier things to 
tackle. I think for that reason it tends to not get the attention it needs,
because it doesn't exactly fit into the box of computer science.

\subsection{Being Aware of Bundle Size}
When you run \lstinline{ng build --prod}, Angular will generate 4 files: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item runtime.*.js
  \item main.*.js
  \item polyfills.*.js
  \item styles.*.css
\end{enumerate}

Of the above, the largest will be main.js files. If we dissect our bundle size, 
it's important to keep in mind that this bundle size will be contributed to by 
a number of different things. This chapter won't go into how to decrease the 
bundle size before it is bundled, but rather after it has been bundles. 

\subsection{Gzip}
gzipping for those that are not familiar, is the process of taking a chunk of 
data and making it smaller. The original data can be restored by un-zipping the
compressed file. Within the context of HTTP protocol, it has the ability to
unzip a file. There is a bit of a cost from the side of the browser to unzip a 
file. However, generally the benefit of a lower bundle size, outweighs the fact
that the browser will have to unzip the file.
