\section{ Track By }
\maketitle{}

In Angular, there are performance enhancements that are valuable here and there.
That being said, it can be hard to miss them. This is one of the few chapters
written with regards to performance. In particular when it comes to for loops
for angular. The way that change detection works, is that if any part of the
array is changed, Angular will agressively change the entire DOM. This is of
course can lead to performance issues.

\subsection{ Using Track By in Angular }
Using *ngFors in Angular is actually quite common. I'm sure many of us listen
to music. I cannot think of one application that doesn't use a data table of
some sort when it comes to displaying the music you are listening to.
