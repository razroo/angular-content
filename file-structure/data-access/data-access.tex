\section{ Data Access }
When working within a GraphQL app, having a manageable way of accessing data
is important.

\subsection{ Data Access Folder/File Structure}
\begin{verbatim}
buyers
  state
    src
      lib
        data-access
          buyer.interface.ts
          buyers.service.spec.ts
          buyers.service.ts
          buyers.fragments.ts
          buyers.mutations.ts
          buyers.queries.ts
        +state
          buyers.actions.ts
          buyers.effects.spec.ts
          buyers.effects.ts
          buyers.facade.spec.ts
          buyers.facade.ts
          buyers.reducer.spec.ts
          buyers.reducer.ts
          buyers.selectors.spec.ts
          buyers.selectors.ts
