\subsection{ When to use Sass Error Reporting }
One should use Sass Error reporting if it is a core style. It is a core style if
it is used in

\subsubsection{ What We Are Looking For With Using Sass Functions }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No values other than these are used
  \item When a Pr comes our way, and we say to use the above, we have a function which is self documenting.
  \item Have a UI of sorts that also trains developers on how the internal of
  the DLS works, so that they should be aware if anything is wrong.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
// Gutter variables, for padding + margin
// function to take in multiplier(8), which must emit of one of values within mc-space-amounts
@function mc-space-multiplier($n) {
  $ill-space-amounts: (0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64);
  $ill-space-multiplier: 8;

  @if(index($mc-space-amounts, ($n * $mc-space-multiplier))) {
    @return #{$n * $mc-space-multiplier}px;
  }
  @else {
    @error "Must contain one of the following numbers: #{$mc-space-amounts}.";
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

In this particular situation this helps, so that if the input passed to the
multiplier is not a number, it will complain. In addition, if the result is not
one of the multipliers, it will complain as well. So for instance, if the number
passed in, is 1.5, it will cause the function to error out, being that there is
no number 12, that is one of the ill space amounts.
