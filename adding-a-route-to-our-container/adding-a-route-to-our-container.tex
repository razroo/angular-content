\section{ Adding a Route to Our Container }

At this point, being that we did not initialize our app with routing
\footnote{So that we may learn as we develop}, we will need to add a routing
file to our app. In our app root, we will be adding an app.routing.module.ts
file.

It will look something like the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=app.routing.module.ts file]
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

import { ChooseSizePage } from './containers/choose-size-page/choose-size-page.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: 'choose-size',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  },
  {
    path: 'choose-size',
    component:  ChooseSizePage
  }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
\end{lstlisting}

In it, we are redirecting the default path to go to the choose-size url. When
the url switches over to choose-size path, it will load the choose-size component.

We are also obviously going to import the AppRoutingModule in our app.module.ts
file:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=app.module.ts file]
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app.routing.module';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    //...
    AppRoutingModule,
    //..
\end{lstlisting}

The next step, is to
