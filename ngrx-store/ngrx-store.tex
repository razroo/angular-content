\section{ State Management - Ngrx/store }

Ngrx/store is a layer on top of Redux. It is a state management tool that was
originally created, in order to solve two way binding performance issues within
Angular. \footnote{Need to further bring source for this one}. It then extended
as a way to bring redux natively to Angular, with the use of Observables.

Let's dive into integrating @ngrx/store into our app. \marginpar{This particular
component has been written in the fashion of TDD. However, another chapter
will be dedicated to TDD/BDD in order to specify this point specifically.}
