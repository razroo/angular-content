 Building our Application 
=========================

In order to go through entire Angular architecture, we obviously do not
want to over due it, nor do too little. It goes without saying, that
your classic todo app, will not suffice. Instead the following is the
application that we will be building.

We are going to call it a pixel to coordinate illustrator. The idea
behind the app, is that we should have a canvas and paint a pixel on
that canvas. We then have a coordinate, that will appear based on where
pixels are currently located.

In our application we have:

1.  Form

    1.  Pixel Size

    2.  Number of Rows

    3.  Number of Columns

2.  Color Picker

    1.  Background Color Picker

    2.  Pixel Color Picker

3.  Pixel Canvas

    1.  Pixel Grid

    2.  Ability to Remove Pixel

    3.  Ability to Add Pixel

    4.  Ability to Change Pixel Color

4.  Coordinate Viewer

    1.  Show x Coordinate

    2.  Show y Coordinate

    3.  Show Pixel Size

    4.  Show Pixel Color

Application will be made responsive. Without further ado, let's begin
our application.
