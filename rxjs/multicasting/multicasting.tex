\chapter{Multicasting}
I've seend Netanel Basel mention this, and he is most definitely right. Of the
entire RxJS bunch, multicase operators are the most complicated topic to 
understand. However, that doesn't mean we can't make it easy to understand. To 
re-iterate if not familiar with already, there are two types of observables in 
RxJS: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item cold 
  \item hot
\end{enumerate}
