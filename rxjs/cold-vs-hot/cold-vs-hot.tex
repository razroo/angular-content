\chapter{Cold v Hot Observables}
One of the foundational understandings of RxJS, is understanding what the 
difference between cold and hot ovservables is. First and foremost, let's 
keep in mind difference:
\begin{quote}
\say{When the data is produced by the Observable itself, we call it a cold Observable. When the data is produced outside the Observable, we call it a hot Observable.}
\end{quote}

There is a lot to unpack here, so let's disect. 

\section{Cold Observables}
To re-iterate, an observable is called "cold", when the data is produced inside of the observable. An observable is only instantiated, once the
subscribe is called. So, we can have something like this: 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=observable without subscribe]
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const randomVal$ = new Subject().next(Math.random());}
\end{lstlisting}
That will actually create an observable, but it will not be called until we add a \lstinline{subscribe} to the code. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=observable with subscribe]
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const randomVal$ = new Subject().next(Math.random());}

// Subscribe to run the combined functions
randomVals$.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
\end{lstlisting}

For that reason, it's possible to have it subscribe mutliple times to a singular observable, yet get different results each time. If in the above 
code, we created two subscribes, so that our code now look like this: 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=observable with two subscribes]
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const randomVal$ = new Subject().next(Math.random());}

// Subscribe to run the combined functions
randomVals$.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
// 0.24957144215097515 (random number)
randomVals$.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
// 0.004617340049055896 (random number)
\end{lstlisting}

As we can see in the comments above, each subscribe will give us a new value.

\subsection{Maintaining Same Value for Both Subscribers}
However, let's say that we wanted to maintain the same random value for 
both subscribers. What we would do, it create a constant outside of the 
subject logic, so that it remains for both. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Turning Cold into Hot]
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const random = Math.random();
const randomVal$ = new Subject().next(random);}

// Subscribe to run the combined functions
randomVals$.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
// 0.24957144215097515 (random number)
randomVals$.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
// 0.24957144215097515 (random number)
\end{lstlisting}

Here, we have moved the data producer(i.e. \lstinline{Math.random()}) out of observable. So, to go back to our definition of a hot, vs cold observable. Being that this data was produced outside of the observable, our observable now just went from being a cold observable to a hot observable. Viola and yes it is that easy! However, as time goes on, you will have to apply this logic to the scenario to truly understand what is producing the data.
