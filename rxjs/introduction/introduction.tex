\chapter{ Introduction to Rxjs }
\mybox{ Rxjs is }

Rxjs has a pretty big place in Angular. I would say that in your average app, 
I would consider it as one of the big three, alongside Typescript, and Ngrx. 
Even though these are independent libaries, when working on enterprise Angular
applications, I personally come across them on a day to day basis. So, while 
they are independent entities to Angular, I very much so consider them as part 
of the Angular framework.
