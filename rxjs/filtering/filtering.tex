\section{debounceTime}
\lstinline{debounceTime} means that if during the buffer time passed to 
\lstinline{debounceTime} method, another event is fired, it will cancel 
previous stream. This is a very common use case that is used within search.
It can also be used it regular event handlers, to prevent from clicking a 
submit button multiple times. However, Angular's internal event handler 
is usually pretty good at this.
