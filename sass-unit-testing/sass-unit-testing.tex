\section{ Sass Unit Testing }

\subsection{ When Does Sass Unit Testing Make Sense? }
One of the concerns with any architecture, is over engineering. With regards to
unit testing Sass, to what extent should one unit test? Should it be for every
class, for every function, any core class used within a framework.

Being that we are going to be creating sass functions for our core theming, it
would make sense to unit test them as well. If they are going to be use in 10,
or more places per each app, then we would like to make sure, that they are
indeed working in the fashion that they should be.
