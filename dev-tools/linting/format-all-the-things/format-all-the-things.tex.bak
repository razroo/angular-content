In a Nrwl setting, we have a format npm script that is available to us by default. It looks something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
  nx format write
\end{verbatim}

This will call a .prettier file that has been created by the nx workspace command. It will automatically format files for you based on the settings inside the file. It's like a pro-active linter that will format code for you.

There are two things you should also know about prettier:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item You will have to format your tslint, so that it does not compete with prettier.
  \item You are going to want to hook up prettier with your IDE, so prettier can go to work without having to run it in your terminal.
\end{enumerate}
