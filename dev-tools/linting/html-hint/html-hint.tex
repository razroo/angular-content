\chapter{ Setting up HTML Hint }

Having a linter for html cannot be overestimated. Within the normal Angular CLI
and Nrwl Nx config, there unfortunately isn't any linting that is provided for
html. The recommended html linter is html hint. It's in a pretty stable
place and provides linting that is beneficial. Some linting rules that it
introudces include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All ids have to be unique.
  \item Double quotation marks have to be used.
  \item No empty tags.
\end{enumerate}

Safe to say, in a large project it is useful.

\section{ To Install  }
\begin{verbatim}
  npm install htmlhint --save-dev
\end{verbatim}
