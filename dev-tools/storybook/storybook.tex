\chapter{Storybook}
Storybook is an incredibly useful tool within your Angular arsenal. It was initially created for React, and I pined for the day something similar would be available for Angular. Well that time quickly arrived, and storybook is now available for Angular. 

\section{What is Storybook}
Storybook is really good at two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enables developers to create components independently. 
  \item Showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment.
\end{enumerate}

It does this by creating an interactive showcase for each component. 

\section{Using storybook within Nrwl Nx}
Nx now offers Storybook out of the box by running: 
\begin{lstlisting}
ng g @nrwl:angular  
\end{lstlisting}
