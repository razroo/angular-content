\chapter{Storybook}
Storybook is an incredibly useful tool within your Angular arsenal. It was initially created for React, and I pined for the day something similar would be available for Angular. Well that time quickly arrived, and storybook is now available for Angular. 

\section{What is Storybook}
Storybook is really good at two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enables developers to create components independently. 
  \item Showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment.
\end{enumerate}

It does this by creating an interactive showcase for each component. 

\section{Using storybook within Nrwl Nx}
Nrwl Nx as usual has made things really easy, by offering storybook out of the box. 

\subsection{Generatng configuration for Nrwl/nx}
This an be done by running the following command: 
\begin{verbatim}
nx g @nrwl/angular:storybook-configuration project-name
\end{verbatim}

This will generate a storybook folder at the root of your workspace if none has been previously created. In addition, this will also generate a project specific folder for your application. 

\subsection{Serve storybook using Nrwl Nx}
\begin{verbatim}
nx run project-name:storybook  
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Cool Features Offered Out of the Box}
Some cool features that are offered out of the box for Nrwl/Nx include the following:
