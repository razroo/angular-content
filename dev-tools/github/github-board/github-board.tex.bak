\chapter{ Github Board }

GitHub has a work board functionality. This can be found on their website and can be used to task manage your team's features and ticket items. 

It can be used to track app considerations - something which cannot be effectively tracked through enterprize software managements tools such as Jira.

For example, if you want to migrate your app to the latest version of Angular, you could create a board called "Tech Concerns" and then add a widget for "Upgrade Angular". Everyone on the team would know that you certain things you'd like to do but not necessary part of the main feature release flow.

This can be used for other items such as changes in directory structures, or integration E2E testing within the app.
