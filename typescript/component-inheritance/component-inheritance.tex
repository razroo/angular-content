\section{ Component Inheritance }

Anyone who has worked with Javascript before frameworks became popular, is well
versed with prototypes in javascript. Arguably the most complicated part of the
language. In short, it allowed for objects(containing whatever you can think of)
, to be inherited by other prototypes. Thereby, allowing one to use classes in
Javascript without explicitly using classes.

[TODO discuss more about prototypes here]

\subsection{ Extending Classes }
In Typescript land, we have the ability to use a class to extend a parent class.
A classic example of this is let's say we have the following parent component:

\lstinputlisting{./typescript/component-inheritance/base.component.ts}

If we were to try and inherit it, using the following child component:

\lstinputlisting{./typescript/component-inheritance/child.component.ts}
