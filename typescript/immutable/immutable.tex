\section{ Typescript - Immutability }
Immutability is one of the core concepts when it comes to data. I first learnt
about it when I was introduced to Redux. However, as time progressed it was
something that I learn to integreate with all of my projects. With regards to
Typescript, it allows type annotations in the way of Immutability:
\begin{lstlisting}
export interface User {
  readonly firstName: string;
  readonly lastName: string;
}

let user: User = {
  firstName: 'Larry',
  lastName: 'Snow'
};

// This will result in a compile time error
person.firstName = 'Pam';

\end{lstlisting}
