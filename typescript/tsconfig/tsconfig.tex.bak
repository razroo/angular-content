\section{ What is the Tsconfig? }
The tsconfig file corresponds to the configuration of the Typescript compiler.

\section{ What the Default Tsconfig Looks Like. }
Angular CLI will generate a tsconfig out the box:
\begin{lstlisting}
  {
    "compileOnSave": false,
    "compilerOptions": {
      "sourceMap": true,
      "declaration": false,
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
      "experimentalDecorators": true,
      "target": "es5",
      "typeRoots": [
        "node_modules/@types"
      ],
      "lib": [
        "es2017",
        "esnext.asynciterable",
        "dom"
      ],
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "@angularPixelIllustrator/*": [
          "libs/*"
        ]
      }
    },
    "exclude": [
      "node_modules",
      "tmp"
    ]
  }
\end{lstlisting}


\section{ Notable Mention }

\subsection{ sourceMap }
Setting the source map to true will help debugging while using the console in the browser.

When debugging unit tests, it will cause some issues to crop up. Sometimes, it's easier to switch it to false until you want to get back into debugging again. Alternatively, you can use the npm script for npm run test using.

\begin{verbatim}
  --source-maps=false
\end{verbatim}

\section{ Using paths }
For our current set up, we are using a mono repo. If we were to pull components from within the lib folder, it would result in a overtly long relative path. 

However, tsconfig has an option to specify a specific path. If you look above, in the tsconfig, you will notice that there is a default path for libs called the angularPixelIllustrator.

In most cases the default name will suffice. However, in our scenario, let's
shorten the lib path. Here's how you do it.

\begin{lstlisting}
+      "@ill/*": [
-      "@angularPixelIllustrator/*": [
\end{lstlisting}

Now when we'd like to import a module/component from the lib folder
from within our app, all we have to do is the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
import {module} from '@ill/color-picker';
\end{lstlisting}
