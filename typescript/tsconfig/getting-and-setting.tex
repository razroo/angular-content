\section{ Typescript - Getting and Setting  }
Creating a getter and setter is a common occurance in OOP paradigm. When using
a class, Typescript offers an internal getter and setter. It is important to
note that within the Typescript documenation, a large part of the reason why
they create setters and getters, is to give a way of intercepting the setting
of a particular element. \footnote{typescriptlang.org\/docs\/handbook\/classes\.html}
