\section{ Implementing service workers in our App }

For those of you unaware, a service worker is a a script that runs in the web
browser that manages caching for an application. So let's say you are offline
and you are making a query in your app that you have already made before, then
the service workers will make it so that request can go through even without a
network request. In short, having a servie worker, can increase dependency on a
network, and will greatly increase the user experience.

\section{ The Angular Service Worker }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Caching an application is like installing a native application.
  The application is cached as one unit, and all files update together.
  \item A running application continues to run with the same version of all
  files. It does not suddenly start receiving cached files from a newer version,
  which are likely incompatible.
  \item When users refresh the application, they see the latest fully cached
  version. New tabs load the latest cached code.
  \item Updates happen in the background, relatively quickly after changes are
  published. The previous version of the application is served until an update
  is installed and ready.
  \item The service worker conserves bandwidth when possible. Resources are only
  downloaded if they've changed.
