\section{ Implementing service workers in our App }

For those of you unaware, a service worker is a a script that runs in the web
browser that manages caching for an application. So let's say you are offline
and you are making a query in your app that you have already made before, then
the service workers will make it so that request can go through even without a
network request. In short, having a servie worker, can increase dependency on a
network, and will greatly increase the user experience.
