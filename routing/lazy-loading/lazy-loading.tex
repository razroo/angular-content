\section{ Lazy Loading Routes }
One of the more initally overlook routing architectures when it comes to routing
is lazy loading. That would simply mean that a module is only loaded once
the page goes to a specific route. This will cause large initial loading times
if all of the pages are initially bundled into the root app.

An example of a Lazy Route is as follows
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  path: 'customers',
  loadChildren: 'lib/users/users.module#UsersModule'
}
\end{lstlisting}
