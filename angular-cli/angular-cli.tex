\section{ Angular CLI }

In any Angular setting the Angular CLI(Command Line Interface) is going to be
a good friend. The following are things which you are able to do, in the Angular
CLI:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create an application out of the box
  \item Generate a module
  \item Generate a component
  \item Generate a route
  \item Generate a service
  \item Serve application
  \item Test application
  \item Lint application
\end{enumerate}

As of now, we will be needing to create a new application. So, let's install
angular cli:
\begin{verbatim}
  npm install -g @angular/cli
\end{verbatim}
Next, inside the directory that you would like to genrate your application, run:
\begin{verbatim}
  ng new pixelIllustrator
\end{verbatim}
This will create a pixelIllustrator folder \footnote{Angular CLI version as of
this writing is: 1.6.1}, with all of our new angular code
inside of it. The directory structure looks as follows:

\begin{forest}
  for tree={
    font=\ttfamily,
    grow'=0,
    child anchor=west,
    parent anchor=south,
    anchor=west,
    calign=first,
    inner xsep=7pt,
    edge path={
      \noexpand\path [draw, \forestoption{edge}]
      (!u.south west) +(7.5pt,0) |- (.child anchor) pic {folder} \forestoption{edge label};
    },
    before typesetting nodes={
      if n=1
        {insert before={[,phantom]}}
        {}
    },
    fit=band,
    before computing xy={l=15pt},
  }
[system
  [e2e
  ]
  [Node Modules
  ]
  [src
    [app]
    [assets]
    [environments]
  ]
  [tests
  ]
]
\end{forest}

\subsection{Ng New Notable Mentions}

\paragraph{End to End Integration}

Created for us an e2e folder. We will be using this for integration tests.

\paragraph{ Linting }

A tslint.json has been created.

\paragraph{ App folder }

Inside of the src folder, a folder has been created for styling, components,
modules, and unit testing. We will add onto this file directory, moving forward.

\paragraph{ Assets Folder}
Any images, fonts, or otherwise go in this folder. When the angular cli command for
pushing to prod is made, it will transfer over the assets folder to the prod
folder. This will make it so that filepaths, as long as relative, will still
work as expected.



% Folder has been created for using integration tests.
