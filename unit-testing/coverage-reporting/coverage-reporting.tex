\section{ Coverage Reporting }

Coverage reporting within the Angular CLI is relatively easy to implement in
this day of age. It's interesting, because as a software engineer, who develops
exclusively using TDD/BDD, coverage reporting becomes of less importance. I
find myself spontaneously checking up on coverage reporting from time to time
(usually every week), to make sure we our hitting the numbers we want.

\subsection{Testivus On Test Coverage}
There is a funny, yet honestly, largly impactful founding post by a one
Alberto Savioa\footnote{https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=204677}.
It is entitled, ``Testivus On Test Coverage''. I would like to post the entire
entry here, because it is so important:

\mybox{
Early one morning, a programmer asked the great master:

“I am ready to write some unit tests. What code coverage should I aim for?”
The great master replied:

“Don’t worry about coverage, just write some good tests.”
The programmer smiled, bowed, and left.

...

Later that day, a second programmer asked the same question.

The great master pointed at a pot of boiling water and said:

“How many grains of rice should put in that pot?”
The programmer, looking puzzled, replied:

“How can I possibly tell you? It depends on how many people you need to feed,
how hungry they are, what other food you are serving, how much rice you have
available, and so on.”
“Exactly,” said the great master.

The second programmer smiled, bowed, and left.

...

Toward the end of the day, a third programmer came and asked the same question
about code coverage.

“Eighty percent and no less!” Replied the master in a stern voice, pounding his
fist on the table. The third programmer smiled, bowed, and left.

...

After this last reply, a young apprentice approached the great master:

“Great master, today I overheard you answer the same question about code
coverage with three different answers. Why?” The great master stood up from his
chair:

“Come get some fresh tea with me and let’s talk about it.”
After they filled their cups with smoking hot green tea, the great master began
to answer:

“The first programmer is new and just getting started with testing. Right now he
has a lot of code and no tests. He has a long way to go; focusing on code
coverage at this time would be depressing and quite useless. He’s better off
just getting used to writing and running some tests. He can worry about
coverage later.”

“The second programmer, on the other hand, is quite experience both at
programming and testing. When I replied by asking her how many grains of rice I
should put in a pot, I helped her realize that the amount of testing necessary
depends on a number of factors, and she knows those factors better than I do –
it’s her code after all. There is no single, simple, answer, and she’s smart
enough to handle the truth and work with that.”

“I see,” said the young apprentice, “but if there is no single simple answer,
then why did you answer the third programmer ‘Eighty percent and no less’?”

The great master laughed so hard and loud that his belly, evidence that he
drank more than just green tea, flopped up and down.

“The third programmer wants only simple answers – even when there are no simple
answers … and then does not follow them anyway.” The young apprentice and the
grizzled great master finished drinking their tea in contemplative silence.

\subsection{The Impact of Testivus}
Testivus has made a huge impact on unit testing. At many organizations that I
have worked at, 80\% will be the golden number. I also like this number,
because it seems to coincide with the Pareto principle. The Alfred Pereto
principle if not already familiar, claims that 80 percent of consequences, come
from from 20 percent of the causes. In a super interesting article, Microsoft
learned that, ``...that 80 percent of the errors and crashes in Windows and
Office are caused by 20 percent of the entire pool of bugs detected''.

So, you might ask why don't we keep the rule to 20\% of the most important
features. Well this might just be an impossible task. For a software engineer
to be aware of potential bugs before they happen, is once again, impossible.
Instead what we should do, is focus on 80\%. This means that we have a 4/5
chance of catching a 20\% bug. In addition, once we cross the 80\% mark, the
odds of us tackling a 20\% bug is decreased. Albeit we have proven 80\% is a
respectable number, is it really that simple?

\subsection{The phenomenon of the Pareto Rule}
The interesting thing about the Pareto rule, is that one can make the argument,
that the 20\% features that make an 80\% impact, are those that are hardest to
debug. So arguably, those tend to overlooked. However, that means that we can
also introduce the Pareto Priority Index(PPI):
\footnote{https://www.sixsigmadaily.com/the-six-sigma-approach-to-project-selection/}

\[
PPI = \frac{\text{savings} \times \text{probability of success}}{\text{cost} \times \text{time of completion}}
\]

The Pareto Priority Index, is really just fancy way of saying, if you find this
unit test is taking you too long, and it's not worth it, granted the unknown
of what this unit test is, move on. So this number(80\%) is debatable, but given
the above, 80\% seems like a very respectable amount.

\subsection{ Understand Different Types of Coverage Reporting }
The following are the four different types of coverage reporting that is
covered:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Statements
  \item Branches
  \item Functions
  \item Lines
\end{enumerate}
