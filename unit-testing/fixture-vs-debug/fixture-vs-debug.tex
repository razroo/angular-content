\section{ Fixture Vs. Debug }

There are use cases, wherein accessing the dom as we've mentioned makes sense
from a unit testing perspective. We want to make sure that the unit test that
we've called, is actually called in the DOM as well. In Angular, there is the
ability to tap into the native element, which is a good old fashioned DOM
Element. Alternatively, there is the option to tap into the debug element. The
debug element offers a wrapper on top of nativeElement.

There are a couple of methods that a debugElement offers over a nativeElement.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item componentInstance
  \item debugElement
\end{enumerate}
