\section{ Benefits of Jest Over Karma  }

Pros
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Faster
  \item Snapshots
  \item Mocking
  \item Well-Maintained
  \item Dev-Ergonomics
  \item Same framework for node backend and frontend
  \item Same framework for Angular and React
\end{enumerate}

Cons
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No browser-specific bugs can be discovered with it
  \item Unfamiliar Debugging
\end{enumerate}

One of the reasons for not using Jest, might be because you want to use Karma
tests. However, in some situations, the way that the tests are written, is that
it would make it very difficult to run them in parallel. In addition, it might
be difficult to conver tests from karma over to Jest. For 3000 tests,
it might take a couple of days to move it over to jests.

Plan of action, we might have the option to only write jests tests, and then
move over to karma, after writing for a month, and being used to the tests.
