\section{ Unit Testing - Event Handling and Text}
In my mind, anything which is considered as architecture is something which
isn't immediately considered as obvious. One aspect of unit testing that tends
to be overlooked, is unit testing event handling. For instance, let's say we
have a filter toggle, wherein we only want the filter to show when a user clicks
on it. This is something which we can trigger from unit tests, without the need
to have go through integration testing. In addition, certain areas of our app
are very sensitive when it comes to text. Focusing on these two alone, allows
our app's integrity to be head and shoulders above the rest.
