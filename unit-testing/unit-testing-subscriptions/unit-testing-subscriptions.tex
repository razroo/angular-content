\section{ Unit Testing Subscriptions }

One of the more complicated things within an Angular architecture, is unit
testing subscriptions. There are many scenarios within a UI application, wherein
an observable cannot be passed directly to the html, for use with the async pipe.
We have mentioned in a previous chapter the need of using the takeUntil operator,
and that is not the intent here to discuss. What is the intent here, is to
discuss how to unit test scenarios where functionality is happening within
subscribe block.
