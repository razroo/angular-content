\section{ Interfaces and Unit Testing }
In unit testing it can be very difficult to keep in sync the mocked data you
are using, with actual data used within app's actual live UI. The easiest, and
most efficient way of doing this is creating interfaces. The part where it
becomes tricky, is that generally data is used in multiple places. For instance,
we might have state that is contained in a separate component, wherein the data
originates from. In addition, the data might also be used in some other component
as well as service.
