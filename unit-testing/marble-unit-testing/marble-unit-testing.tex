\section{ Marble Unit Testing }

Unit testing observables, heck working with obserables is never really easy.
Primarily, it's not the logic one will come across in other parts of one's
application. As opposed ot regular logic, where one has the option to simply
console out logic and see what is there, then and there, one does not have that
option wih observables. Observables are a stream and in the context of
javascript it is an object that will a series of functions. In addition, an
Observable as a stream contains more than one snippet of data in it's entire
lifecycle.
