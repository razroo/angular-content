\section{ Mocking Data }
An interesting phenomenon that happens within many enterprises, is with regards
to unit tests and maintanability. Many times the data mocks are repititions of
themselves. In addition, utilities with regards to mocking data. I've done this
myself, maybe you have as well. This chapter is simply there to put this in as
convention, to go ahead and edit moving forward.

\subsection{ Function Composition }
With regards to creating re-usable data, there are two options. One can use a
function to generate a mock. Alternatively, one can use a spread operator. For
the most part, I prefer a function to generate a mock. It gives the option to
specify parameters to be passed through.

\begin{lstlisting}
// this interface is in our users.interface.ts file
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
}
// this interface is in our users.interface.ts file
export interface Users {
  users: User[]
}

let generateMockUserData: User = (data: user) -> {
  user[id]: {
    user
  }
}

let generateMockUsersData: Users = (data: user | user[]) -> {
  users: {
    ...data
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

By using the simple above function, properly type annotated we have the option
to generate mocked data that is unique to our interface. In addition, we have
the ability to pass in data as it is unique to our specific use case.

\subsection{ Core Constants }
In addition to having function composition tied to our interfaces, odds are that
the data being passed in might have the same signature time and time again.

Enter the three constant rule:

\begin{lstlisting}
const genericMockUser: UserEntity = {
  id: '123',
  name: 'Mr. Nice',
  location: New York
}

const genericMockUsers: Users = {
  generateMockUsersData(
    generateMockUserData({
      id: '123',
      name: 'Charles',
      location: 'New York'
    }),
    generateMockUserData({
      id: '246',
      name: 'Lisa',
      location: 'London'
    }),
    generateMockUserData(
      {
        id: '468',
        name: 'Yoda',
        location: 'Canary Islands'
      }
    ),
  )
}
\end{lstlisting}
