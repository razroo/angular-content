\section{ Unit Testing Performance }

Unit Testing isn't neccesarily one of those things that we tend to equate with
performance. There are tools that allow one to a unit test by a specific folder.
In addition, there is parallel unit testing, for the pipeline, so that unit
tests can be sped up. However, as apps get larger, so do their unit tests. From
a developer perspective, it is valuable to run all unit tests, to make sure
that when larger impacting edits are made, that none of the unit tests are
failing. Unit tests will be run when a pr is being made. In addition, they are
going to be run when deploying. So there is enough going on, to say that being
conscious of performance boost is something which is important.
