\section{ Cypress }

Cypress is a test runner. Ideally in a larger team, there will be a QA team
which will write their own test runners. There is a benefit of redundancy,
however, what Cypress also enables, is the ability to make certain unit tests
irrelevant. It is a very hot topic, whether, or not to use cypress over
protractor. 

 More so, than using an alternative such as protractor.



Pros
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Writing and debugging tests is a lot easier (Go through list of what
  can do).
  \item Tests are more reliable
  \item They can be faster (Being able to pass in keys directly)
  \item Can mock http directly. For OAuth, one has the ability to pass in
  directly.
  \item Dashboard
\end{enumerate}

Cons
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item No cross borwser testing just yet
    \item
  \end{enumerate}

  5000 unit tests, 100 e2e tests
  1000 units test, 300 e2e cypress tests

  More so for debug elements, than bypassing a state lifecycle.

  --> Use it on a sample app to use with Jest
