\section{ Writing E2E Tests }

In addition to our Unit Testing, another very important element of our app is
End to End Testing. We have discussed in the previous chapter how automation
engineering is an integral part of this chapter. In addition, we discussed how
when automation engineers are brought into the picture, it might be superfluous
to have end to end testing. Nonetheless, I am a fan of having UI Engineers
write their own E2E tests within the app.

\section{ Angular CLI }
The Angular CLI will create out of the box a e2e folder that can be used for
creating e2e tests. It can be run by
\begin{verbatim}
  ng g e2e
\end{verbatim}
. If you have an npm script within your app, running
\begin{verbatim}
  npm run e2e
\end{verbatim}
will work as well. Follow the steps through. Usually, the only thing that will
be needed from your end, is downloading the chrome-webdriver needed for running
the e2e tests. Suprisingly, there aren't actually any ways of generating an e2e
test from within your angular cli.
