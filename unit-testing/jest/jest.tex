\section{ Jest }

\subsection{ A Primer. }
Jest is a test runner created by Facebook to allow for the "Delightful
Javascript Testing".

\subsection{ The Benefits of Jest Vs. Karma }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fast and sandboxed
  \item Built-in code coverage reports
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ Fast and sandboxed }
Jest parallelizes test runs across workers to maximize performance.
Console messages are buffered and printed together with test results. Sandboxed
test files and automatic global state resets for every test so no two tests
conflict with each other.

\subsubsection{ Built-in code coverage reports }
One has the ability to create code coverage reports using --coverage.  No
additional setup, or libraries are needed. Jest can collect code coverage
information from entire projects, including untested files. The way it moves
focus away from something like istanbul is fantastic. The UI, in my humble
opinion, for what it's worth, is not the greatest.
