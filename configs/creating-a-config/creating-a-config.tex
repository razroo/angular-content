\section{ Creating a Config }

\textit{ Note: Creating your own config for the most part is not ideal. Ideally,
configs should be altered in the backend and pulled in as an api. However, many
apps will experience iteration, even in larger enterprises. This chapter
therefore deals with the importance of having configs available within app. In
addition, the importance of having a config within app.}

With the mono repo architecture we are using, let's assume that our code is
going into the \appNameKebabCase{} folder. It will be in the common folder,
wherein there will be a configs folder. Something like this:

\begin{forest}
  [\appNameKebabCase{}
    [common
      [configs]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}
