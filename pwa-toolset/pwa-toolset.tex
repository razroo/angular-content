\subsection{ Physical Devices }
There is currently a formula with which devices to use. Latest regular sized
Iphone, and Iphone Plus. Latest Google Pixel non plus
\footnote{That's right, skip the Samsung.}. Latest Ipad + Ipad Mini. That
is it. These are mostly used as a way to see web in real time, as you are
developing your application.

Therefore, the reccomended Physical mobile devices are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Iphone 8
  \item Iphone 8 Plus
  \item Google Pixel 2
  \item Ipad (2018)
  \item Ipad Mini 4
\end{enumerate}
