\section{Error Handling}
\maketitle{}

This chapter is a bit different then the rest of the chapters in the book. Many
technologies by simply knowing about them, you are heads and shoulders above the
rest of them, simply by knowing about them. For instance, if you were to know
ngrx/store, ngrx/entities, apollo/graphql, that is more than enough to prod you
in the right direction with regards to fantatic architecture. However, one thing
that I've noticed by working in many different apps, that tends to fly under
the radar, is error handling.
