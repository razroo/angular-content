\section{ Color Picker }

Let's go through the steps again, being that we are creating our second
component. Part of learning is not only discovery, but maintenance. As discussed
in the preface, whenever we have the chance to repeat steps we have discussed
once before, we will re-iterate them on a high level for memory sake.

\subsection{ CLI - Creation of Module and Component with Routing }
First, let's create our component in the lib folder of our app.

\begin{lstlisting}
ng g lib color-picker --routing
ng g component color-picker -a=color-picker --export
\end{lstlisting}
