\section{ Building our Application }

In order to go through the full gamut of Angular, we are going to focus on as
lightweight of an applicaiton as possible. In order to go through entire Angular
architecture, we obviously do not want to over due it, nor do too little. It
goes without saying, that your classic todo app, will not suffice. Instead the
following is the application that we will be building.

We are going to call it a pixel to coordinate illustrator. The idea behind the
app, is that we should have a canvas, paint a pixel on that canvas. We then have
a coordinate, that will appear based on where pixels are currently located.
