 Weekly Meetings 
================

Weekly Dev Meetings is something that can be extremely beneficial to the
team at large. A large app that is managed without a planned, methodical
method of approaching the code base, might end up getting tangled in
places here and there. In addition, it is a great forum for software
engineers to be able to show off what they've seen. Some items that have
been discussed in meetings, include the data-access architecture,
organizing of interfaces. This helps to tidy corners in places wherein
help may not have been an option beforehand.
