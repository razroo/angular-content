\chapter{ Npm Vs. Yarn }

One of the inevitable conversations that comes into play when starting to use
an app for the first time, is whether, or not to use yarn. Once upon a time,
yarn introduced a yarn.lock file. This was fantastic, and really did increase
install time. In addition, the syntax was a bit more intuitive, such as yarn
add, vs npm install. However, as time progressed, NPM received it's own lock
file. Performance time between the two became negligable. In addition, yarn
always came with it's own set of problems. I remember a package giving me an
error once that really took me sometime to solve.

\section{ Reasons to stick with NPM }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item There are no noticable differences between Yarn and NPM
  \item NPM has been borrowing features from Yarn.
  \item NPM has it's own package lock.
  \item NPM Ci, will tell differences between package.json and package.json.lock.
\end{enumerate}

That's really all the argument there is need to be had. At this point in time
Yarn really does not offer anything valuable in ways of NPM. I am thankful for
the contributions they have made to ecosytem. However, having the entire team
use Yarn, when it doesn't come at a particular advantage and at times at a
dis-advantage does not make complete sense.

So, if your team is curious which package manager to go with, unless they have
a personal preference as a collective unit, feel free to tell them NPM.
