 Code Reviews 
=============

There are multiple ways of doing something. If the code reviewer leaves
a comment for doing something in an alternate way and the person
receiving the code resists, then the code reviewer has no right to
insist on her/his way. It is then important that to move forward, the
team needs to agree on a convention.

Setting Conventions
-------------------

Another important part of the code review process is to set conventions.
In my humble opinion, the reason conflict happens with regards to code,
is due to uncertainty. When there are conventions set up before work on
code happens it is to point to code guidelines and say this is what we
do. In addition, someone has the ability to challenge code guidelines,
and it is more challenging code guidelines. This allows those involved
in discussion to save face.

 A Time to Learn 
----------------

It is also very important for others to learn. It is a way for me as the
code reviewer to ask what a certain piece of code does. A good
convention is that if it is something new that you haven't done before,
then you can ask about it and learn about it. This is one of those
points that is obvious yet it is passed on more than most.

 A Time to Mentor 
-----------------

It is also a time to setup across the app, and specifically make junior
developers code owners. Thereby mentoring them and bringing them up to
speed on what needs to be done.
