\section{ Smart Vs Dumb Components }

In any UI framework, following a smart component, and dumb component
architecture, is going to be a good idea with regards to re-usability.  It will
completely change the way(if it hasn't already), the way you go ahead and build
your components. It is one of those design patterns that you will ineviabtly
learn how to do on your own, but why take the hard way(i.e. reading this chapter)
when you have chance to just read this chapter. If you are already familiar,
feel free to keep reading, I worked hard to make sure there is something to
learn as well.
