\section{ Github Board }

The github board, for open source projects is used in a task management
capacity. In an enterprise setting, it can be used to track the one thing
that can't be tracked through JIRA, app considerations.

For instance, let's say you would like to migrate your app to the latest version
of Angular. You would create a board called "Tech Concerns". You would then go
ahead and create a widget for Upgrade Angular. Everyone on your team would then
know that you have certain things that you would like to progress in tech.
This can be used for other items as well, such as change directory structure to
use mono repo, or integrate E2E tests within app.
