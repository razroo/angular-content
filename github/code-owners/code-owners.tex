\section{ Creating Code Owners }

As we have discussed previously, Github is our preferred client for pull
requests. As the team grows larger it becomes imperative, that default code
reviewers are setup. Creating a \codeowners{} file is the easiest way to do this.

\section{ What is a CODEOWNERS file? }

specify which github users are considered as \codeowners{} for a specific project.
