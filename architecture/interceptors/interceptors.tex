Client middleware over Angular's Http Interceptors, as that is Razroo's 
reccomendation. Third, I would like to bring in code examples, so that it will
be easier for the dev reading this to get up and running.

\subsection{Dissecting Two Ways of Creating Interceptors}
Within our architecture we assume that your backend team will be using GraphQL. 
However, this is something that is beyond you as a UI Engineer. As a result,
we give a head nod towards there being multiple apis, including those using a 
regular RestSvc. 

\subsection{ Popular Scenarios For Using Interceptors }
Just to make it so, so that someone embarking on interceptors on the first 
time can be aware, as well, as those who have already worked on it. In
particular, so they can reference this chapter when working on them again. 

\subsubsection{ Authentication }
Starting from what will be time, and time again, the most important
