\chapter{ Custom Web Components }
Really, what makes a framework, a framework, is it's ability to tie together the different parts of the application into something larger. This includes services for data requests, files for interfaces/type checking, state management, rendering engine, and the ability to pass inputs and outputs to each other.

One very intelligent piece of architecture that will be getting more press as time goes on, is creating custom web components within you application. This allows for your dumb components to be independent of framework, and to be re-used wherever. 

I would promote this practice by default to use in any application that you work on. All dumb component should be created as a custom web component, so any team can modify it. 

\section{Before We Get To Nx}
Before we get to Nx, I would like to discuss one thing that really at this point bothers me. Nx controls too much of my code. If the team at Nrwl decides to take the direction of paid code, or documentation is lacking, I am screwed over. It really seems like a large price to pay, for tooling that can be created by my own team. So while I am going to reccomend using Nx, so that I don't through the rabbit hole too much, I am going to attempt to create this solution on my own as well. 

\section{Using Nx}
Granted you are working within the Nx workspace which I highly reccomend,
