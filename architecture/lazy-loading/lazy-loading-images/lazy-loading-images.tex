\chapter{ Lazy Loading Images }

Even though we discussed lazy loading modules, we might also want to lazy load 
the content inside of the lazily loaded modules. There is a very popular 
article from \href{https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/}{Google} 
that is generally spread around with regards to performance for webpages. 
In short, it presents the following very persuasive set of data: 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{@{} l *4c @}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{\color{red}As page load time increases}\\
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{\color{red}Seconds} & Probability of Bounce \\
    \midrule
    1s to 3s       & Increases by 32\% \\
    1s to 5s       & Increases by 90\% \\
    1s to 6s       & Increases by 106\% \\
    1s to 10s       & Increases by 123\% \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}  

As we can see with the data presented above, performance of our webpages are 
very important. More so it presents the data very clearly that the faster 
a webpage is, the higher probability there is to retain our user base.
