\chapter{ Network Aware Pre-Loading }

Pre-loading is a strategy baked into the router in Angular, that allows for
modules to pre-loaded when it becomes available. Lazy loading modules, allows 
for modules to be optimized, so that the initial load, only includes the page 
the user is navigating to. This helps to decrease the initial load time. 
However, depending on how expensive including a module is, pre-loading can
save you time. 

\section{ Being Aware of How Much Time Pre-Loading Saves }
You might be curious as to how much time is actually saved with regards to 
pre-loading? I was curious as well. I tried personally, and the amount of 
time saved, to be honest, is negligable. However, I also realize that the 
app I am working on has a minimal amount of modules. I can see that for 
another app, wherein there are multiple modules that are loaded. Therefore, 
let's throw out an arbitrary number. If you have a module that is going to 
use more than 20 imports inside of it's module, then worry about a pre-loading 
strategy. That being said, it is something that you should be aware of, and
here is how to go around following that strategy.
