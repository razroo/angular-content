\section{ Why Build a Progressive Web App? }
When building a an enterprise application, think about building a Progressive Web App. It will allow your web experience to be built to feel as if it is a native app experience. Not only will it make it progressive, but it will make your users feel as if they are a part of an experience that is all encompassing. 

\section{ The Technical Benefits of a PWA }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Progressive} - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they're built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
  \item \textbf{Responsive} - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
  \item \textbf{Connectivity} independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.
  \item \textbf{App-like} - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions.
  \item \textbf{Fresh} - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
  \item \textbf{Safe} - Served via TLS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
  \item \textbf{Discoverable} - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.
  \item \textbf{Re-engageable} - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
  \item \textbf{Installable} - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
  \item \textbf{Linkable} - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.
\end{enumerate}

We will go into detail in the following chapters, into detail

\section{ Developing a PWA - The Toolset - An Overview}
When Developing Mobile First, there are three tools, which will be particularly advantageous:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Physical Mobile Devices \footnote{A moment on which one's it is, that
  you should work on}
  \item Sauce Labs \footnote{Section on why we chose Sauce Labs, over Browser
  Stack}
  \item Chrome Dev Tools \footnote{Section on why we chose Chrome Dev Tools,
  over Firefox}
\end{enumerate}

\section{ Developing a PWA - Software - An Overview}
When developing a PWA, it is important for us to keep in mind, that there will be specific pieces of software to develop. Of course, there is an official PWA checklist \footnote{https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist}, but specific technologies, would be as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Service Worker
  \item Manifest
  \item Lighthouse
\end{enumerate}
