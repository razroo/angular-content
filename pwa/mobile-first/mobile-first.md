 Why Build a Progressive Web App? 
---------------------------------

When building a an enterprise application, think about building a
Progressive Web App. It will allow your web experience to be built to
feel as if it is a native app experience. Not only will it make it
progressive, but it will make your users feel as if they are a part of
an experience that is all encompassing.

 The Technical Benefits of a PWA 
--------------------------------

1.  **Progressive** - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice
    because they're built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.

2.  **Responsive** - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or
    whatever is next.

3.  **Connectivity** independent - Enhanced with service workers to work
    offline or on low quality networks.

4.  **App-like** - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style
    navigation and interactions.

5.  **Fresh** - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update
    process.

6.  **Safe** - Served via TLS to prevent snooping and ensure content
    hasn't been tampered with.

7.  **Discoverable** - Are identifiable as "applications" thanks to W3C
    manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search
    engines to find them.

8.  **Re-engageable** - Make re-engagement easy through features like
    push notifications.

9.  **Installable** - Allow users to "keep" apps they find most useful
    on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

10. **Linkable** - Easily share via URL and not require complex
    installation.

We will go into detail in the following chapters, into detail

 Developing a PWA - The Toolset - An Overview
--------------------------------------------

When Developing Mobile First, there are three tools, which will be
particularly advantageous:

1.  Physical Mobile Devices [^2]

2.  Sauce Labs [^3]

3.  Chrome Dev Tools [^4]

 Developing a PWA - Software - An Overview
-----------------------------------------

When developing a PWA, it is important for us to keep in mind, that
there will be specific pieces of software to develop. Of course, there
is an official PWA checklist [^5], but specific technologies, would be
as follows:

1.  Service Worker

2.  Manifest

3.  Lighthouse
