\section{ The Value of a Continuous Testing Cloud? }

As we have mentioned in the chapter for physical devices, we have quite a bit of different platforms to work on. Ideally, we want an environment that we can set up with E2E test as well as integration tests, and then run on all environments. 

This is on top of the physical devices we already have. 

The idea of physical devices is as follows: to have a real time update of all edits being done in your local environment, so that you can go ahead and have a continuous local development environment.

The idea of a continuous testing cloud, is to be able to check that all devices and browsers are being properly tested on. This will work strictly with one's e2e tests.

\section{ Bring it to the Table - Why We Chose Sauce Labs }

At this point in time, there are really two main competitors, when it comes down to continuous cloud computing:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sauce Labs
  \item BrowserStack
\end{enumerate}

Before we go into the above, end test which is a fantastic up and comer, is unfortunately a victim of it's own business model. 

While allowing users to create simple version of tests, it also locks in users to its platform. There is no way of exporting these tests, and it makes it a very uncomfortable place for many enterprises.

vs.

The competition for BrowserStack vs. Sauce Labs is pretty stiff. They have many of the following similar features:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Platform
  \item Languages Support
  \item Framework
  \item Support
  \item Browser Release Support
  \item Browser Support
\end{enumerate}

However, the following are the reasons why we believe Sauce Labs is the better choice. Sauce Labs has quite the roster of large clients, and it's fantastic documentation shows. In addition, because Sauce Labs is widely used, we are able to find better community support. Channels such as StackOverflow for a specific quirk.
