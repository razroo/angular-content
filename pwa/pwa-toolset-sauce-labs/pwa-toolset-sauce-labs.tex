\section{ The Value of a Continuous Testing Cloud? }

As we have mentioned in the chapter for physical devices, we have quite a bit of
different platforms to work on. Ideally, we want an environment that we can set
up with E2E tests, as well as integration tests, and then run on all environments.
This is on top of the physical devices we already have. To clarify\footnote{i'm saying this a completely friendly way}

The idea of physical devices is as follows: to have a real time update of all
edits being done in your local environment, so that you can go ahead and have a
continuous local development environment.

The idea of a continuous testing cloud, is to be able to check that all devices
and browsers are being properly tested on. This will work strictly with one's
e2e tests.

\section{ Bring it to the Table - Why We Chose Sauce Labs }

At this point in time, there are really two main competitors, when it comes
down to continuous cloud computing:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sauce Labs
  \item BrowserStack
\end{enumerate}

Before we go into the above, endtest which is a fantastic up and comer, is
unfortunately a victom of it's own business model. While allowing users to
create a very simple version of tests, it also locks in users to it's platform.
There is no way of exporting these tests, and it makes it a very uncomfortable
place for many enterprises. This is precisely the type of application we are
trying to focus on, in this book, so we shall move on. \footnote{Even if I were
working on a small app, I would still not use endtest, for fear of scale}

\section{ Sauce Labs }

vs.

The competition for BrowserStack vs. Sauce Labs is pretty stiff. To be honest,
at this point, they should go for different marketplaces, or one of them should
go under. They have many of the following similar features:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Platform
  \item Languages Support
  \item Framework
  \item Support
  \item Browser Release Support
  \item Browser Support
\end{enumerate}

However, the following are the reasons why we believe Sauce Labs is the better
choice. Sauce Labs has quite the roster of large clients, and it's fantstic
documentation shows. In addition, because Sauce Labs is widely used, we are able
to find better community support. Channels such as StackOverflow for a specific
quirk.
