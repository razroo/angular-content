\section{ Ngrx Entity }

The Ngrx repo until recently had many similar functionalities to your regular
redux app. It included actions, reducers, selectors. However, there has been
efforts to go ahead and create libraries for aspects of ngrx that can perhaps
be re-usable. One of these is ngrx entities.

\section{ Ngrx Entity at a High Level }
At it's core, ngrx entity is an API for manipulating and querying entity
collections. In particular:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reduce boilerplate for creating reducers that manage a collection of
  models.
  \item Providing performant CRUD operations for managing entity collections.
  \items Extensible type-safe adapters for selecting entity information.
\end{enumerate}
