\section{ Ngrx Effects }

\subsection{Ngrx Effects - A Primer}
Ngrx effects can be one of the more ambigious parts of the ngrx stack. They are
by definitition something that is supposed to happen when something else has
happened. It will listen for a particular action, and true to Ngrx, return an
observable. In this observable one will have the option to do whatever they want
as well as publish(return) to the action stream.

The line, however, can be blurred, however, as to what the difference is between
an ngrx/effect and a ngrx/store. It is therefore important to distinguish for
architectural reasons.

\subsection{Differece between @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effect}
I rarely quote articles within this book, but there is one article by a one
Tanya Gray entitled, "Understanding NgRx Effects and the Action Stream". It is
perhaps my number one article of all times, for it's ability to take an
otherwise very complicated subject, and making it very easy for anyone to
digest.
