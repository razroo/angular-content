Creating a design language system the key to a clean architecture. Within
Angular the Full Gamut, we are going to assume that you are using Material
Design as your design language system. 

Material Design is a robust library for creating visually appealing Angular components. When you want to modify something, it's good to have a light design language system to scaffold your code creation process.

\section{ Identifying Key Points of DLS }
The following are the 10 points that are a part of a design language system:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Colors
  \item Styles
  \item Icons
  \item Grid and Spacing
  \item Typography
  \item Buttons
  \item Form Controls
  \item Navigation
  \item Cards and Portlets
  \item Data Tables
\end{enumerate}

\section{ Identifying Proper Architecture }
When you want to overide material design, this is where architecture kicks in. 

\subsection{ Colors }
Material design has the ability to be 'turned off' through overriding the sass file. You can override material theme by using Sass Variables. So it would look something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
@import 'src/styles/themes/blue-orange';
@import 'src/styles/material-overrides/material-overrides';
\end{lstlisting}

Doing something like the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
$gray-50: #fafafa;
$gray-200: #dbe1ea;
$gray-300: #e0e0e0;
$gray-400: #cccccc;
$gray-500: #bdbdbd;
$gray-600: #9b9b9b;
$gray-700: #757575;
$gray-800: #444444;
$gray-900: #212121;
\end{lstlisting}

Now the colors you have are specific to your app.

\subsection{ Grid and Spacing }
This one etc.
