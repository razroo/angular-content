\section{ Material Overrides }

Based on Razroo best practices, we have established the easiest way to get 
your app up and running, is to use material design within your Angular 
application. Generally, an organization will want to roll it's own theme into 
Angular Material. When that happens the developer will have to go ahead and 
customize the build for material design. Let's talk about how we can go ahead 
and do that. 

\subsection{Material Design and Sass}
First and foremost, we have already established that we will be working within
a Sass environment. Material Design offers Sass out of the box, and makes it 
incredibly easy to customize your environment based on sass overrrides. 

\subsection{Npm Install Material Theme}
First and foremost, let's make sure that we have properly installed and Angular
Material in our Angular application. 
\begin{lstlisting}
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
\end{lstlisting}

You package.json will now include packages needed to use Angular Material 
within the application in general. In addition, the package
(\lstinline{@angular/material}) to make the Sass changes we so dearly need. 

\subsection{Import Material Design and Call Core Styles}
The next step, is for us to go ahead and import Material Design in our 
\lstinline{styles.scss} file. The \lstinline{styles.scss} file can be found
in the root Angular application \lstinline{src} folder.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=styles.scss]
@import '~@angular/material/theming';
// always include only once per project
@include mat-core();
\end{lstlisting}

\mybox{You will notice that we are adding a tilda\lstinline{\~} next to the
node module folder, containing the sass file we need. This tell the sass that
file we would like to import is located inside of the \lstinline{node\_modules}
folder.}

What the above does is import the \lstinline{theming.scss} file that contains
all of the theming variables for material design. We are also calling the
\lstinline{mat-core()} function, which is a, \begin{quote}
\say{Mixin that renders all of the core styles that are not theme-dependent.}
\end{quote} \footnote{This quote can be found in the \lstinline{_theming.scss 
file}}
