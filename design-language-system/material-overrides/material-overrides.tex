\section{ Material Overrides }

Based on Razroo best practices, we have established the easiest way to get 
your app up and running, is to use material design within your Angular 
application. Generally, an organization will want to roll it's own theme into 
Angular Material. When that happens the developer will have to go ahead and 
customize the build for material design. Let's talk about how we can go ahead 
and do that. 

\subsection{Material Design and Sass}
First and foremost, we have already established that we will be working within
a Sass environment. Material Design offers Sass out of the box, and makes it 
incredibly easy to customize your environment based on sass overrrides. 

\subsection{Npm Install Material Theme}
First and foremost, let's make sure that we have properly installed and Angular
Material in our Angular application. 
\begin{lstlisting}
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
\end{lstlisting}

You package.json will now include packages needed to use Angular Material 
within the application in general. In addition, the package(@angular/material)
to make the Sass changes we so dearly need.
