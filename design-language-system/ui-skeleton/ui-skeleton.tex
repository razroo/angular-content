\section{ UI Skeleton }
\maketitle{}

Within a design language system, a UI Skeleton, or Ghost Elements, as it should
probably be called, is a good idea. Most commonly, it is gray box depiction of
UI component awaiting action, that will be available in the future.

\subsection{ Three Ways of Implementing Ghost Views }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ghost Overlays which use a separate component to render the ghost DOM.
  These components will overlay/underlay the real DOM that is pending.
  \item Inline Ghosts which use the same DOM element to show ghosts, or actual
  DOM with business logic.
  \item Inline Ghosts with Async Loads, which will use data wrapper, to allow
  data items to track state. The state will then be reflected in the view
  components.
\end{enumerate}
