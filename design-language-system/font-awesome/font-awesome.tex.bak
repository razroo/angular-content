I would like to dedicate a quick chapter to icons. I've never come across a modern application that doesn't use some form of iconography in its design. Users need to make a decision and icons speed up the process. very app has to make the decision, what icons they are going to use. My suggestion is, if you aren't already doing so, is to use a icon font library called Font Awesome.  

\section{ Font Awesome }
Font-awesome is one of the largest icon library currently available, and the pro version is relatively cheap (there is a free version available).

In addition, there are many particulars with icons that they solve, making sure that they look good on different devices. Unless your team have your own fonts, font awesome is a quick and robust library for rapid prototyping. Here are some benefits of using Font Awesome:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pixel Perfect, Consistent Look.
  \item 5,000 icons and growing.
  \item Ability to play with Size on Web.
  \item Accesibility Minded
  \item Desktop Friendly.
  \item Tried and Tested, by the whole community.
  \item Multiple ways to use. CDN, Download yourself, install via NPM.
\end{enumerate}

It's wide adoption and longevity has helped it be a consistent tool for many projects and developers.
