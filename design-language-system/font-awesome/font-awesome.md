 Icons 
======

I would like to dedicate a quick chapter to icons. I've never come
across a modern application that doesn't use some form of iconography in
its design. Users need to make a decision and icons speed up the
process. very app has to make the decision, what icons they are going to
use. My suggestion is, if you aren't already doing so, is to use a icon
font library called Font Awesome.

 Font Awesome 
-------------

Font-awesome is one of the largest icon library currently available, and
the pro version is relatively cheap (there is a free version available).

In addition, there are many particulars with icons that they solve,
making sure that they look good on different devices. Unless your team
have your own fonts, font awesome is a quick and robust library for
rapid prototyping. Here are some benefits of using Font Awesome:

1.  Pixel Perfect, Consistent Look.

2.  5,000 icons and growing.

3.  Ability to play with Size on Web.

4.  Accesibility Minded

5.  Desktop Friendly.

6.  Tried and Tested, by the whole community.

7.  Multiple ways to use. CDN, Download yourself, install via NPM.

It's wide adoption and longevity has helped it be a consistent tool for
many projects and developers.
