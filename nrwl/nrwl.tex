\subsection{Arguablyâ€“The Greatest Strength of Angular}

Arguably one of the greatest strengths of the Angular(2+) ecosystem is
consistency(a point we've discussed before). As a result, Angular has the most
advanced Front End Framework CLI.

\subsection{Angular CLI Shortcoming with Regards to State Management}

However, the Angular CLI does not deal with state management. State management
in Angular2, for the most part should be done using NGRX. State management in
it's self, however, can be unwieldy. For every new reducer, a new constant file,
as well as action, effect, and proper unit testing files are needed.
In addition, the Angular Framework is not built around state management. It is
easy for it to fall through the cracks, and for an app to be done without it in
the first place. Introducing the Nrwl nx CLI.

\subsection{NX CLI}
NX is built by a team called Nrwl. They are perhaps thought leaders in the
Angular space, as they well should be, being that a large part of them came
from the core Angular team. They decided to build a cli around state management.
However, using their cli comes the following pre-conditions, include the NX
Workspace.

\subsection{Introducing the NX Workspace}
One of the things that the Nrwk team really tries to push, that isn't mainstream
yet, is the concept of a workspace. Perhaps you will remember an article
floating around a while back, about

{Google's Mono Repo}. [Worth noting, this idea
has been popularized at

as well]. The idea is that there is a singular repository for everything.
The benefits of such are
