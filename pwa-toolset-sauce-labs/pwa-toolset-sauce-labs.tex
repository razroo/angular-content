\subsection{ The Value of a Continuous Testing Cloud? }

As we have mentioned in the chapter for physical devices, we have quite a bit of
different platforms to work on. Ideally, we want an environment that we can set
up with E2E tests, as well as integration tests, and then run on all environments.
This is on top of the physical devices we already have. To clarify\footnote{i'm saying this a completely friendly way}

The idea of physical devices is as follow: to have a real time update of all
edits being done in your local environment, so that you can go ahead and have a
continuous local development environment.

The idea of a continuous testing cloud, is to be able to check that all devices
and browsers are being properly tested on. This will work strictly with one's
e2e tests.
