\section{ Mobile First - Building a Progressive Web App }

When building a an enterprise application, think about building a Progressive
Web App. It will allow your web experience to be built to feel as if it is a
native app experience. Not only will it make it progressive, but it will make
your users feel as if they are a part of an experience that is all encompassing.
It will give them the overencompassing feeling that they are getting the best
experience possible \footnote{We will discuss moving the app over to a native
app soon using NativeScript.}. Swipe right on Progressive Web Apps \footnote{
That is a millenial joke, but also a darn good PWA pun.}
