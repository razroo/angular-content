\section{ Dependency Injection }

Dependency Injection is one of the sticking points of angular. It makes it
distinctively different than other frameworks in this regard. That being said,
it is very important to understand the nuances of injection when it comes to
architecture when it comes to unit tests, performance, and re-usability.

\subsection{ Understanding Providers }
As per the angular documentation, "Dependencies are services or objects that a
class needs to perform its function. DI is a coding pattern in which a class
asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself."
If you are reading this book, the understanding is that you have already have
an idea of what dependency injection is, and how services might work. However,
because dependencies are a large part of files that Angular will be using,
properly understanding the specifics can have a large impact on performance.

\subsection{ providedIn metaData }
The @Injectable decorator has the providedIn metaData option. It will allow you
to specificy the root, or a specific module for the service to be injected in.
To clarify, what this means, is that if root is specified as the providedIn
metaData, for instance:
\begin{verbatim}
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class UserService {}
\end{verbatim}

It will be considered as a singleton in your application, meaning that you can
use this service anywhere you want in your application, without having to
specify it as a provider.
\subsubsection{Make Unit Testing Easier}
This makes unit testing easier, as it is no longer neccesary to specify
service in in unit testing module. However, being that it is good practice
to mock services, it is still reccomended to do the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
// let's assume we have a users mock elsewhere, that we are importing in
class MockUserService{
  getUsers() {
    return users;
  }
}
beforeEach(() => TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: {provider: UserService, useClass: MockUserService}
}));
\end{lstlisting}

In fact, one can argue, that the fact that it will not error out in one's unit
test, might make unit testing even more difficult. Nonetheless, performance is
where providedIn: Root is very valuable.
