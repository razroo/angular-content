\section{ Dependency Injection }

Dependency Injection is one of the sticking points of angular. It makes it
distinctively different than other frameworks in this regard. That being said,
it is very important to understand the nuances of injection when it comes to
architecture when it comes to unit tests, performance, and re-usability.

\subsection{Understanding Providers}
As per the angular documentation, "Dependencies are services or objects that a
class needs to perform its function. DI is a coding pattern in which a class
asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself."
If you are reading this book, the understanding is that you have already have
an idea of what dependency injection is, and how services might work.
