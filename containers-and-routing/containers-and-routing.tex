\section{ Containers, Routing + Ngrx/router }

We now have a choose-size component, as well as a choose-size module.
The dynamics of our app, is that there will only be two parent pages. One will
be the choose-size page. The other will be the draw page. When a user goes to
the page for the first time, they will see the choose-size page. Therefore we
are going to add two routes in our app.

In our app.module.ts, we will use the existing RouterModule that has been
created by Nx, and include it in our RouterModule:

\begin{verbatim}
  // Inside imports add
   RouterModule.forRoot([
    {
      path: '',
      redirectTo: 'choose-size',
      pathMatch: 'full'
    },
    {
      path: 'choose-size',
      component: ChooseSizeComponent
    }
\end{verbatim}

\marginpar{git commit -m 'Add a routes to the RouterModule, for the choose-size page.'}

Now that we have redirected the default homepage to re-direct to the
choose-size page, let's try it out. Open up http://localhost:4200, and your page
should navigate to the choose-size page, with the text, "Choose Size Works",
towards the bottom of the page.
