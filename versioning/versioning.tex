\section{ Versioning }

\subsection { Git }
It goes without saying that you should be using Git. Unless you have an
incredibly huge diffing tree in your repo, which is most of us, then you should
be using Git.

\subsection { Integration with JIRA }
In any JIRA ticket, if one has the proper webhooks setup with Github, or if one
is using BitBucket, then it will automatically hook up the commit into the
ticket. All that is neccesary, is for the the commit message to include the
ticket name. \marginpar{Screenshot for example should go here}.

\subsection { Analyzing a Git Branch }
In any git environment, the name of the git branch is important for the
following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It can inform the developer about the type of branch
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item feature
      \item hotfix
      \item bugfix
      \item refactor
    \end{enumerate}
  \item It can inform the developer of ticket being worked on
  \item It can inform the developer of abstract of ticket.
\end{enumerate}
