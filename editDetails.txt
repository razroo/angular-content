Thoughts and suggestions:

The current structure jumps around quite a bit. As a fellow Angular developer, I understand where you're going with the content but from a beginner/advancing intermediate dev new to Angular, this may be a little too jagged and confusing.

There is also a lot of future - we will do this later, we'll talk about this later - that pads out a lot of the content. This is removed to create focus. 

Sidebars are rebranded to sidesteps because it can confuse people reading it as creating an actual side bar in the app. 

Suggestions:

- add an overview of what the Pixel Illustrator will look like.
- add a learning outcomes outline to help set up expectations and track progress.

Overused word list/unecessary padding:

wherein, really, "We will discuss this in detail in another chapter.", "if you are not already familiar", "cookie cutter code", "This chapter is a bit different", "for instance", fantastic, "in regards", "the most single", "if not already aware", "Without going into detail", "For clarity sake", "to begin", "We'll discuss this a bit more", "For the sake of brevity", "lets discuss" (followed by no discussion), "In addition", actually, "I would like to explain" (sometimes not followed by an actual explanation), " as we discussed above", "in addition", "If not familiar with already", "I just want to re-iterate", "with regards", "First and foremost", singular (often followed by another suggestion, making it not singular), granted, "I think it goes without saying", "nitty gritty", "extremely powerful", "it is important to point out", "which we will discuss more", "For those of you unaware", "time and time again", really

Common repeated issues:

incorrect usage of commas
incorrect usage of footnotes

Chapter by chapter notes rundown:

2. Dependency Graph
[ ] dependency graph screenshot 
[ ] using dependency graph content

3. Angular CLI
[*] Tone edited
[*] Angular CLI commands added to list as reference for devs
[ ] Needs note on why service worker is important / what it does 

4. Introducing Nrwl Nx ***
[*] Tone edited
[*] Too much expected knowledge required. Attempted to quickly encapsulate state for the reader. 
[*] Revised links and short summary of linked articles
[*] Article links moved to footnotes for further referencing
[*] command line error fixed. 
[*] Added more details on how to create a workspace. Assumes too much prior knowledge from reader. 
[*] managed to get nrwl nx running, but the instructions currently in the book is still too sketchy to be error free. Chapter technical notes need to be reviewed. 

5. Compodoc
[*] Addition information added with rewrites on paragraphs to unify overall tone and constant switching.
[ ] compodoc is still quite vague. Needs a little more detailing and how it relates to the overall pixel illustrator project.
[*] Final thoughts section removed. Too much insider knowledge and not enough details to explain why. 

6. Using Angular CLI in an Nx Workspace
[ ] author is assuming that reader knows what encapsulation means
[*] removed footnotes. Too distracting with eyes having to jump around
[*] --export flag edited. --exports doesn't exist

7. Creating Code Owners
[*] repeated content removed. 

8. Github Wiki
[ ] very vague section. Not sure how it all fits it. Feels more like a side thought section.

9. Github Board
[ ] can technically be combined with the github wiki section and just have it as one side stepping section on github workflows?

10. Format all the things
[*] removed condescending tone in relation to IDE types

11. Lint all the things
[ ] Too much looking into the future. General trend of the book, which can be frustrating to read because you have to remember all these things that is going to be coming soon. Get's repetitive and confusing.

12. Linting HTML
[ ] html is part of the markup family and is different from xml in its special way. 
[*] changed tone to be less waffle/condescending and more objective strength
 
13. Linting Sass
[*] changed tone to appear more confident
[*] less random yelling
[ ] repetition is ok, but not in the same sentence. Then it just looks like you're trying to pad out the paragraph.

14. Accessibility with Codelyzer
[*] content runs off into a tangent train of thought style that was confusing to follow. Re-edited to make it easier and clearer to read. Not sure if I recaptured all your thoughts correctly.
[*] removed condescending tone

15. Lighthouse
[ ] It took a while to figure out what your issue with lighthouse was...edited the paragraph to be clearer. It went off on a tangent and not enough information to substantiate it. 
[ ] you keep saying things are useful but don't really explain what the usefulness of those things are
[ ] feels incomplete. 

16. Setting up Schematics using Angular CLI
[*] Double negative opinion that contradicts with previous chapters removed. Too much thinking required to try and understand what you're trying to convey.

17. Schematics Deep Dive
[ ] started off better but then got confusing when trying to explain json.

18. px schematics
[ ] reworded some paragraphs and got rid of filler words

19. Nrwl Schematics
[ ] confusing chapter. Are you creating nrwl schematics or angular schematics or nrwl angular custom schematics?

20. Storybook
[ ] chapter is incomplete. Cannot proceed properly.

21. Data Access interface
[ ] intro doesn't work. I'm sure you haven't introduced data access folder. 
[ ] interface context not established or linked to a specific chapter.

22. Data Models
[ ] no focus or flow. Attempted to edit as much as I could. 

23. Interfaces and Partials
[ ] this is an incomplete section

24. Tsconfig
[ ] run on sentences edited

25. Component Inheritance
[ ] minor edits made for grammar and clarity

26. Barrel File
[ ] minor edits made for grammar and clarity

27. Typescript - Getting and Setting
[ ] some edits for clarity

28. Typescript - Immutability
[ ] doesn't explain what immutability is. Will be very confusing for a person who doesn't know what it is. You need to answer these question: what is immutability? Why is it important? how does it fit into the context of Pixel Illustrator?

29. Declaration Files
[*] edit for increase clarity. Has more information but not really centralized around a clear idea. 

30. Custom Declaration Files
[*] edited for increased clarity. Removed and edited personal opinion to make it more accessible to readers
[ ] incomplete chapter content

31. Design Language System
[ ] Needs to stop arguing without presenting the actual argument. 'arguably' is more a filler word at this point based on structure and style. 

32. Material Design
[ ] incomplete chapter. Feels very surface level.

33. Customize Angular Material Design
[ ] removed misinformation from the final paragraph. Angular Material runs off material design principles, which is a set of UX principles released by Google. Angular Material is a UI component library that is open sourced and while it's run by the core angular team, there are others contributing to it as well.

34. Angular Material Typography
[ ] tone feels like there's a personality switch. Are you Razroo or are you Charlie Greenman?

35. UI Skeleton
[ ] random side stepping removed. Too jumpy and makes the reader stutter.

36. Icons
[ ] a list is not a dicussion. It's just a list of features.

37. Sass Error Reporting
[ ] removed inconsistencies and word/page padding.

38. Introduction to RxJS - The RxJS Airplane
[ ] removed some word padding and reformatted to corect LaTex formatting

39. Debugging Rxjs

40. Cold vs Hot Observales
[ ] minor formatting issues and spelling

41. RxJS Common Creation Operators
[ ] introduction doesn't make sense
[ ] switching personalities between Charlie Greenman and Razroo. 

42. Combination
[ ] filler words removed and reformatted 

43. Filtering
[ ] formatting cleaned up

44. Transformation
[ ] formatting cleaned up with minor content edits

45. Utility
[ ] doesn't really explain what untility is

46. Multicasting
[ ] more like a comment than actual section on what multicasting is. Still doesn't answer the question: what is multicasting?

47.RxJS Pitfalls
[ ] minor edit but overall excellent chapter that clearly explains RxJS

48. RxJS and Facades
[ ] the first paragraph is a bit confusing. Attempted to edit for increased clarity.

49. Creating a Config
[ ] formatting edit. Better content but lacks context.

50. Creating Feature Flags

51. Environment

[ ] spelling fixed

64. Form Validation
[ ] edited the detected inverse sentences
[ ] removed confusing half sentences that cannot be decrypted

65. Angular Elements - Introduction
[ ] minor edits

66. Using React with Angular
[ ] note: react is a library and not a framework. There are also different versions of 'React' and extends beyond webbased applications. You need to make the distinction clear or else you'll loose credibility
[ ] there is a lot of initial knowledge required by the developer on both Angular and React or deduce what you're trying to achieve. I think the content needs to be simplified a bit more, or introduce a chapter that quickly goes over how React works. You're assuming too much prior knowledge from the reader. Ideas, libraries etc are introduced without actually going into what they are.

67. Custom Web Components
[ ] reader may still be unclear on exactly what nrwl and nx does.
[ ] removed name dropping. out of context and condescending.
[ ] hard to follow because the content feels like you're in a private conversation with yourself and the reader doesn't have a clue what you're trying to get at. Edited as much as I could without having to research and rewrite (out of scope)

68. Micro Frontends
[ ] minor edits for spelling and grammar

69. Static Site Generation
[ ] no content. Cannot edit.

70. Smart vs. dumb components

115. Scully: Static Site Generation for Angular
[ ] I wrote this for you a while back. Just a note that it's already been published on Razroo's Medium.

116. When to use @ngrx/store
[ ] I understand where you're trying to go with this section. However, the your argument over the repetition effect is flawed. People are attached to what is familiar. Repetition increases familarity. It also increases our ability to recognize patterns in future encounters. That's why all pop music sounds the same to people over a certain age - it's because they've become accustomed to patterns, while the younger generation may argue that they are different. Just a thought.
