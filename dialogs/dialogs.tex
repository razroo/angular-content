\section{ Dialogs }

There are certain components that are expected in any architecture. Dialogs are
one of those components. However, their architecture can be so complex, that it
is very important to come up with a strategy that works with state management.
This architecture was originally adopted from Thomas Burleson who I have a
tremendous amount of respect for.

A couple of issues that dialogs have, is that they are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Defined in Templates
  \item Created at App Startup
  \item Managed in UI Components
  \item They complicate UI Components
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Open, close, cancel
      \item Services
      \item Store Actions
      \item Pending State
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Dialogs may interupt NgRx Flows
\end{enumerate}
