\section{ Authorization }

Authorization is a corner stone of any project. Many Greenfield projects will
not have the ability to implement authorization right away, as backend will not
have the capacity to do so. However, one of the cool things about authorization
is that one has the ability to set it up ahead of time. When data from the
backend comes in, the authroization service and directives will be ready to do.
