\section{ Introduction to @ngrx/store }

As discussed in the chapter on the History of State Management, there has
been quite a series of progression with regards to state management. Redux, is
the mature concept of state management including actions, reducers, and a single
application store. \footnote{This is a footnote for more information on state management}.
Angular's @ngrx/store, which is not front and center, is where redux meets Rxjs.
Rxjs is the Javascript library for using observables
\footnote{More on Observables can be read here}.

\subsection{What Makes @ngrx/store Different than Redux?}
When considering this question, it is more important to consider what is
reactive programming. Reactive programming in particular introduces two concepts
\footnote{http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Gerard.Berry/Papers/Berry-IFIP-89.pdf}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Asynchronous \footnote{Meaning one event fires after the previous one is
  complete, unlike synchronous which means they all fire at the same time, and
  might complete out of order.}
  \item Deterministic \footnote{Always produces the same results. As a side
  effect of this, code becomes very much so cookie cutter, which is great in
  an enterprise setting, as it allows for greater re-use.}
\end{enumerate}
