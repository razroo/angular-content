\section{ Introduction to @ngrx/store }

been quite a series of progression with regards to state management. Redux, is
the mature concept of state management including actions, reducers, and a single
application store. \footnote{This is a footnote for more information on state management}.
Angular's @ngrx/store, which is not front and center, is where redux meets Rxjs.
Rxjs is the Javascript library for using observables
