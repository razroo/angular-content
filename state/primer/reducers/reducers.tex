Reducers are pure functions that take in data \footnote{Should take in data only
and for the sake of this primer, we are going to keep it this way.}, and return
a new data object. Immutability is ideal when using reducers, so that data is
not affected by mistake, when being passed down the pipeline. Reducers tend to
be universal across all frameworks, and usually consist of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item One exported function
  \item A switch:case statement based on action.type
\end{enumerate}

\section{ Example of Reducer }
\begin{lstlisting}
export function reducer(state = initialState, action: book.Actions
| collection.Actions): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case: CodeBoxActionTypes.CodeBoxLoaded {
      return {
        ids: [ ...codeBoxIds ],
        entities: Object.assign({}, codeBoxEntities),
        selectedCodeBoxId: state.selectedCodeBoxId
      }
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This reducer will be called whenever any action is called. However, only if
the action matches the case statement, will the reducer actually run.
