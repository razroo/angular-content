\section{ History of State Management }

I wanted to write this, because having a history of state management put's into
perspective, the use of state management. In addition, as someone who might be
considering being an architect of front end, it can be very advantageous to
know the history to be aware of alternatives. First and foremost, Jquery was
created a very long time ago, already back in \href{2006}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery}.
Show, hide, remove, add, as well as element selectors, were already present in
V1 (http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.0/). Javascript had this capability
as well if need be. However, no one really thought of it as state management.

A classic component, I remember that was always created with Jquery, would be
photo sliders. In the more elequent apps, they would use singleton classes,
perhaps \href{prototypes}{https://www.w3schools.com/js/js\_object\_prototypes.asp}
if they knew what they were really doing. Variables would be cached by
initializing once. Functions would be kept small, and everything including css,
would have very unique nomenclature(\href{BEMCSS}{http://getbem.com/introduction/}
for instance).
