\section{ Re-using Reducer Logic }

In an Angular setting, when using side effects heavily for one's app, the action
name becomes heavily tied to the way an application is intended to be used. For
instance, let's say that we hava fileUpload service that is going to be used in
our app, in an number of settings. What the file upload allows does, is allow
for file to be uploaded and then retreive the metadata for the file that has
been uploaded. However, we might use this file upload service to upload the
file to different places. However, the logic for all of them is the same. When
file is uploaded, ids are returned to be used as attachments.

However, the logic is the same for both for the actions, facade, reducer, and
effects. Is there a way that we can re-use logic within our app?

In order to re-use logic, we can do the following.
