\section{ Facade Pattern }

\subsection{ What is the Facade Pattern? }
The facade pattern is a classic. Anyone who has read the GoF book \footnote{
which if you haven't you should probably take a look.} knows that it is a
mainstay of computer science. Quoting from the GoF book:

\say{A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body
 of code, such as a class library.}

\subsection{ Facade Pattern an Example }
This pattern is particularly advantageous when it comes to ngrx actions. If I
may, let's imagine we have the following action:

\begin{lstlisting}
export class LoadChooseSize implements Action {
  readonly type = ChooseSizeActionTypes.LoadChooseSize;
  constructor(public payload: any) {}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Now any time that we have to call an action we have to do two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Have a store select within the component.
  \item Call a dispatch.
\end{enumerate}
