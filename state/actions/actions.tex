\section{ Primer - Actions }
At this is a definitive guide, and covers all aspects of the framework, one
would be remiss without going through the entire lifecycle of the store, and
mentioning it here.

An action is a function with contains two very important pieces of information:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What the name of the action is. \footnote{Why this is important we will
  get to soon}
  \item The payload of the action. Which is a single object, containing all the
  data passed into the store.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{An example of an Action in an Angular setting}
An Action is pretty generic across different frameworks. \footnote{For certain
frameworks, this is less relevant, such as React + Vue.}. However, within an
Angular setting, it means that we are using @ngrx/store for controlling state
across our app.
