\section{ Data Access }

Without going into the problems that data-access architecture is trying to solve
instead, I would like to present one simple argument. State, while it should
ideally be tied to a feature, as the app moves on, might not neccesarily be
tied to a specific feature, or page. In addition, +state by nature, as a single
giant object, is global by nature. Also, it takes up a large portion of any app.
It definitely makes sense to put all state in a single repository, so that state
within the app can be transparent(go into this a bit more). Finally, for testing
purposes, state is a very large chunk of business logic for app, and deserves
it's all module for bundling, and testing purposes.

\subsection{Data Access Folder/File Structure }
State being a way of accessing data, an appropriate name for the folder/file
tree for state makes sense to be called data-access. It will look something
like the following:

\input{./state/data-access/data-access-tree-structure}
