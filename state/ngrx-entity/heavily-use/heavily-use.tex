\section{ The Case for Heavily Using Ngrx/entity }
Ngrx/entity for me personally, is the most exciting part of ngrx/entity. Simply
because it is a library based on comp sci fundementals of building an ngrx/store
database. In SQL databases, there is a concept of database normalization. For
instance, let's imagine we have a set of data. In our table, and we would like
to retrieve data from it. The data in JSON formate can look something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
  interface codeBox {
    id: string;
    color: string;
    xPosition: number;
    yPosition: number;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Now, let's imagine we have a an array of these codeBox types that we would like
use, that look something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
  interface codeBoxCollection {
    codebox: codeBox[]
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Now this means, that if we want to select a certain piece of data within our
database table, things can be a little bit tricky. In order to access, for
instance, a certain section of our table, we would need to loop through all of
the data, and then find the appropriate set of data with id that we want.

Instead, what would make out data table more efficient, is if we have a table
of ids that corresponds directly to our table of data.
