\subsection{ Lint all the Things }

Linting is incredibly important. Think of it this way. Someone's favorite food
item might be brocolli, another person's favorite food item, might be steak.
Now the two might work well together(on a number of levels, mmm hungry), but
forcing one person to adopt the other food item as their favorite, is unjust!

Ok, bad example, but the concept is the same. Things such as how many spaces per
indentation, double quotes vs. single quotes, trailing commas, empty interfaces,
these are all important points. To be honest, I've only found my peers arguing
on more minute points, such as double vs. single quotes, and how many spaces
per indentation. Therefore, linting allows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Agreement on code formatting rules.
  \item Automated way of keeping track of things that need to be changed.
  \item Self documentation through cli, on what needs to be changed.
  \item 
\end{enumerate}
