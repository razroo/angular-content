\section{ Unit Testing TDD - First Princples Discovery }

Unit testing as a discipline is something which is very hard to write. Writing
a good unit test is as much as a discipline as writing good software. In
addition, if someone is following TDD standards, then knowing of all the unit
tests ahead of time can be very difficult. Leading many developers to leave the
TDD environment. If they do write unit tests, it will be towards the end. The
following is a great way, and as far as I am concerned the best way to discover
unit tests.

\section{ What is First Princples Thinking? }
In Physics\footnote{Not a physicist, but I heard of this concept the first time
from Elon Musk. I am, however, a Talmudist, and in talmud we have a similar
concept called Pilpul}, there is a concept called, first principles thinking.
This means boiling down a priciple to it's essnetial truth and then building up
from there. With regards to Unit Testing, and specifically test driven
development, this principle will help to create fantastic unit tests.
