\section{ Compodoc }
Having a documentation tool within your app is important. The following are
items which a documentation tool can be of benefit for your app:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Overview of app chart.
  \item List of Modules, components, directives, classes, injectables, interfaces
  and pipes.
  \item Documentation Coverage
  \item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ Install Compodoc }
npm install -g @compodoc/compodoc

\subsection{ Add to package.json in a Nrwl Workspace Setting }
\begin{verbatim}
  "compodoc": "compodoc -p tsconfig.json",
  "compodoc-serve": "compodoc -s tsconfig.json",
\end{verbatim}

Using the above will include all components in a Nrwl workspace setting. You
will end up getting something that looks like this. \marginpar{put image here}
