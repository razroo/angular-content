\section{ Constants }

\subsection{ What is a Constant? }
In Javascript the idea of having a constant would be assigning a variable, to a
particular value. Whenever we would like that value, instead of typing out the
value, we would use the variable. At first, however, it might seem
counter-intuitive. Why use the constant value, if it is literally named the same
thing as the actual value?

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example of a Constant]
// Update last updated value to have latest payload data
const LAST_UPDATED = "LAST_UPDATED";
new updateValue(payload, LAST_UPDATED);
\end{lstlisting}
