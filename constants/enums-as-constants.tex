\section{ Enums as Constants }

When working with Typescript, which if you are using Angular, then you most
definitely are using Typescript \footnote{I look forward to working with
Reason sometime soon for typechecking, but I digress.}. Care must be taken to
look into all the nuances that Typescript can offer.

\section{ In a non Typescript Setting }

In order to define a constant in a non-Typescript setting, we use the const
declaration to define variables:

\begin{lstlisting}
  const UP = "UP";
  const DOWN = "DOWN";
  const LEFT = "LEFT";
  const RIGHT = "RIGHT";
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ Enums an Introduction }
Very simply, Enums allow us to define a set of named constants
\footnote{https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html}.

\begin{lstlisting}
  enum Direction {
      Up = "UP",
      Down = "DOWN",
      Left = "LEFT",
      Right = "RIGHT",
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ Benefit of Enums over Constants }
Enums allow us to organize a collection of related values. Think of them as
a class for values, wherein the value can only be a string , or number.

\subsection{ Current quirk of String Enums }
String Enums, as opposed to number Enums, have to be constant initialized
with a string literal. To clarify, you might want expect the following to work:

\begin{lstlisting}
  enum Direction {
      Up = "UP",
      Down = "DOWN",
      Left = "LEFT",
      Right = "RIGHT",
  }
\end{lstlisting}
