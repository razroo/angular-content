Assuming your app is using /href{https://graphql.org/}{GraphQL}, you will have
to choose a client to use with GraphQL. Without going to into detail, we will be
using Apollo Client as we truly believe it is best client for GraphQL. Within
Apollo, there are numerous different files that one can create to interact
with GraphQL.

\subsection{Four Types of Apollo Client Files}
Most notably there are four different types:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/features/fragments}{fragments}
  \item \href{https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/basics/queries/}{queries}
  \item \href{https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/basics/mutations}{mutations}
  \item \href{https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/features/subscriptions}{subscriptions}
\end{enumerate}

This section is not a time for us to go into detail for each. However, the
question is, where within our Angular Directory Structure should we go ahead and
put it within our app.
