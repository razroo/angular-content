\section{ Interfaces and Unions }

In GraphQL, and more in particular, because we are working on things from the
UI side of things, a Union type gives us the ability for one field to contain
more than one field. The best way to really think of it, is in terms of
Typescript. A union type would be:
\begin{lstlisting}
  type Book {
    title: String
  }

  type Author {
    name: String
  }

  type Result = Book | Author;

  type Query {
    search: [Result]
  }
\end{lstlisting}

As we can see, it is telling us that it can be one, of the other with regards
to data type. So instead of returning irrelevant data, we only return the data
we need. This is beneficial for a number of reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It lightens payloads
  \item Allows for succint sorting, on front end. I.e. do not have to sort from
  the backend.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ Using Unions with Apollo }
This is where at this time, things start to get really interesting.
