\section{ Routing }
\maketitle{}

Routing is an integral part of any single page application:
\begin{displayquote}
\say{It allows a user to navigate from one view to the next, as a user performs
application tasks.} \footnote{Angular Documentation - Routing \& Navigation https://angular.io/guide/router}
\end{displayquote}
The idea is that routing is that it is it's own internal state machine. There
are two things that are unique to state with regards to routing:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Data to be pulled in based on page.
  \item UI to be shown based on page.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Basics}
In any Angular application, there is going to be an initial point of entry for
routing. In an Nx/Angular CLI setting, this is going to be your
\lstinline{app.component.html}.
