\section{ Routing }
\maketitle{}

Routing is an integral part of any single page application:
\begin{displayquote}
\say{It allows a user to navigate from one view to the next, as a user performs
application tasks.} \footnote{Angular Documentation - Routing \& Navigation https://angular.io/guide/router}
\end{displayquote}
The idea is that routing is that it is it's own internal state machine. There
are two things that are unique to state with regards to routing:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Data to be pulled in based on page.
  \item UI to be shown based on page.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Base Href}
In any Angular application, there is going to be an initial point of entry for
routing. First and foremost, in your src/index.html you will need to add an
\lstinline{<base href="/">}. This is added by the CLI by default, and not
something you have to worry about.

\subsection{ RouterModule }
Routes in Angular, are singleton instance.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=app.module.ts file]
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot( [
      {
        path: '',
        component: AppComponent
      },
      {
        path: 'draw',
        component: GridComponent
      },
      {
        path: '**',
        component: PageNotFoundComponent
      }
    ], { initialNavigation: 'enabled' })
  ],
})
export class PixelAngstAppRoutingModule {}
\end{lstlisting}

As we can see in the above, we are supplying all routes within the app routing
module.

\subsection{ RouterModule Options }
Let's break down all the possible options that can be passed to the router:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item url
    \begin{lstlisting}
{
  path: 'draw',
  component: GridComponent
},
    \end{lstlisting}
    Here we are using the url for draw. So, for instance, let's say the url
    of our application is razroo.com, then razroo.com/draw, will display
    the grid component.
  \item id
  Many times within our backend, we are going to retreive data, based on the 
  user's id. Alternatively, it might also be the id for a specific api. Being
  able to tie in the id for that particular api, into the route is very 
  powerful. Angular routing allows for this to happen: 
  \begin{lstlisting}
  { 
    path: 'hero/:id', 
    component: HeroDetailComponent 
  },
  \end{lstlisting}
  The syntax of colon, following by text(does not have to be id), means that 
  if we were to navigate to \lstinline{razroo.com/draw/123}, it would 
  register within our app, that we want to call the id of '123', within
  the draw route. 

  Within our app, we are going to use this, so that we can use the custom 
  pixel illustrator that our user opted into. 
  \item data
  \item empty path
  \item ** path
\end{enumerate}
