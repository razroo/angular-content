\section{ Transitions and Triggers }

It is worth noting that there are a number of transition states. We discussed 
from open to close, and from close to open. There are, however, other states 
that are equally as important to discuss. 

\subsection{ Wildcard Matching }
Using an asterisk in a transition state, will represent any sort of situation. 

For instance, let's say were to use: 
\begin{verbatim}
  open => closed 
  open => *
  * => closed
  * => *
\end{verbatim}
All of the above four, will match when an element's state changes from open to 
anything else. A good rule of thumb, is that similar to routing, wherein the 
asterisk will be a wild card meant to match any remaining use cases, animation
transitions also follow in this same vein.
