\section{ Animations }

Animations have come a long way. It's one of the most jaw dropping effects
that any application can have. Angular has made it, so that animations can be
baked into the framework. I would like to run through how one would go ahead
and implement a simple animation within your component, so that you can get an 
idea of how you can do it. 

\subsection{ Include Animations Module }
Angular has a \lstinline{BrowserAnimationsModule}, which is based off of the 
\lstinline{BrowserModule}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=app.module.ts]
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule
  ],
  declarations: [ ],
  bootstrap: [ ]
})
export class AppModule { }  
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ Importing animation functions into component files }
Just something to be aware of. Angular has many animation functions that can  asdasdasdasd
be used out of the box.
