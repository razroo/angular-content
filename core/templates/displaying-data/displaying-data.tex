\section{ Displaying Data }

In Angular, one of the nicer things about the migration from AngularJS to 
Angular, was that many html bindings felt at home. If you are someone who like
me, had the ability to experience Angular, after working with AngularJS, then 
templates feel entirely intuitive. In fact, I actually had a difficult time 
writing this chapter, because I almost overlooked the fact, that to many,
displaying data in an Angular setting can be counter intuitive.

However, I still think that it rings true, that templates in Angular, are one 
of the easier topics to grasp in Angular. Granted, and this is a very important 
point, granted that the syntax is properly explained. Sometimes, when learning 
syntax for the first time, there's so much there, that it's easy to overlook 
reasons behind syntax. Perhaps we assume the reason there are different symbols,
letters, etc. for the different ways of operating within a framework, is
because we just need to represent the different ways of doing a particular 
action within a framework. The following is a great example of what I mean: 
\begin{lstlisting}
  
\end{lstlisting}
