\subsection{ Difference between Property and Attribute in HTML }

First, and foremost, it is important to understand the difference between HTML 
attributes and properties. I know myself, when writing this chapter, I realized
that I did not fully understand the difference between an HTML attribute, and
an HTML property. So I thought, why no re-iterate here, and hopefully it will
make this subject a bit easier to understand. First let's dive into what the 
computer science definition of a property, and an attribute would be. 

Property - Something that can be read and written. Within a typescript setting, 
this would be something that would be translated into a \lstinline{get} and  
\lstinline{set} within Typescript. 

Attribute - More correctly should be considered as a metadata. Something that
is a property of a property, describing what the parent property is doing. 

In HTML, the above definitions are a bit obscured. For instance, let's say
that we are defining the type of input field, as well as it's value. 
\begin{lstlisting}
<input type="text" value="Name:">  
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline{type} and \lstinline{value} are attributes, as they are 
explaining what the \lstinline{input} property is doing (aka metadata).
However, once the browser parses the code, it will turn it into an 
\lstinline{HTMLInputElement} object. This contains dozens of properties, like 
\lstinline{className}, \lstinline{clientHeight}, and methods, such as 
\lstinline{click()}. The browser will create a new sort of property based on 
the type of native html element it is creating. 

\subsection{ Property Binding (In Angular) }
In Angular, property binding is a way 



\mybox{\lstinline{<script>} tags in Angular, unlike modern html are forbidden!
It will result in an error. This is done to prevent from script injections.}
