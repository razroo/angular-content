\section{ Dependency Injection }
\maketitle{}

Dependency Injection on it's own a important design pattern. It solves the
following problems in any scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can a class be independent of how it's objects are created.
  \item How can way objects are create be specified in different configuration
  files.
  \item How can an application support different configurations?
\end{enumerate}

Angular has adopted dependency injection as part of it's framework since the
inception of AngularJS. When using dependency in real world applications, it
immediately becomes obvious that it is extremely useful for unit testing. Less obvious, but something somewhat intuitive as well, is that it helps keep bundle
sizes compact. In addition, as we discussed above, it allows us to keep our
configurations separate. While the ability to export/import is an option within
Typescript, dependency injection, allows the framework to be completely aware
of everything being used within the framework.

\subsection{ Real World Example }
The DI(Dependency Injection) Framework, allows for an injectable service class
to be passed to a component. For instance, let's say that we want to create an
Injectable service, we would do the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class PxCodeService {
  constructor() { }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This code right here is doing two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is saying that this service is an Injectable.
  \item It is saying that this injectable should be provided in the root.
\end{enumerate}

\mybox{Now would be a good time to discuss what the \lstinline{providedIn}
property does. It does two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Angular creates a single, shared instance of the service and injects it
  into any class that asks for it. So, there is no need to insert it as a
  provider for your module, and you can simply pull it into your class whenever
  you want. \footnote{Don't worry if you are not familiar with how to use a
  service in your class, we will get to that soon.}
  \item It also allows Angular to optimize an app, by removing the service from
  the compiled app, if it isn't used. \footnote{Taken from documentation for
  Angular.}
\end{enumerate}
}

Now if we would like to include this service in our component, we would do the
following:
\begin{lstlisting}
// code-box.component.html
<div *ngFor="let codeBox of codeBoxes">
  {{codeBox.data}}
</div>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
// code-box.component.ts
import { Component }   from '@angular/core';
import { CodeBox }        from './code-box.interfaces';
import { PxCodeFacade } from './hero.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'px-code-box',
  template: './code-box.component.html',
  styles: ['./code-box.component.scss'],
})
export class HeroListComponent {
  codeBoxes: CodeBox[];

  constructor(pxCodeFacade: PxCodeFacade) {
    this.codeBoxes = pxCodeFacade.getCodeBoxes();
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
