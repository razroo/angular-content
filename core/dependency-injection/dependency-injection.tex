\maketitle{}

Dependency Injection on it's own a important design pattern. It solves the
following problems specifically in Angular:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can a class be independent of how it's objects are created.
  \item How can way objects are create be specified in different configuration
  files.
  \item How can an application support different configurations? 
\end{enumerate}
