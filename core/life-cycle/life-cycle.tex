\section{ Life Cycle Hooks }

Any framework these days is going to have a lifecycle hook. All of them are
actually very similar in many ways. There's a component has instantiated,
and in between someplace, as in about to change, and is undergoing change, or
what not. There is also, always a part in the lifecycle where the component
is being destroyed/is destroyed. Angular is no different. I would like to
go through the different part's of Angular's life cycle hooks, as it definitely
is very important when it comes to development. I would also like to discuss the
top 3 most important life cycle hooks when it comes to Angular development.

\subsection{ Lifecycle Example }
Before we get into what the entire lifecycle is, it might be helpful to
visualize a lifecycle hook:

\begin{lstlisting}
export class PeekABoo implements OnInit {
  constructor(private logger: LoggerService) { }

  // implement OnInit's `ngOnInit` method
  ngOnInit() { this.logIt(`OnInit`); }

  logIt(msg: string) {
    this.logger.log(`#${nextId++} ${msg}`);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code is hooking into the onInit lifecycle hook. (Hook is exactly what
it sounds like. Angular will hook into that particular part of the lifecycle,
and implement a certain piece of code). When the component is initialized,
it will log out a certain message. OnInit from personal experience is the most
used lifecycle hook, so something to keep in mind.

\subsection{ Angular Lifecycle }
At this time, Angular has eight lifecycle hooks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ngOnChanges() - Triggered whenever Angular sets, or resets the data-bound
  input properties. It is called before ngOnInit, and whenever one, or more
  data-bound input properties change.
  \item ngOnInit() - This one was already featured in the code above! It get's
  called after Angular display data-bound properties, and set's the directive,
  or component's input properties.
  \item ngDoCheck() - This is called after an ngOnChanges, or ngOnInit. This
  was created, so that Angular can check on updates it won't check on it's own.
  \footnote{Example of what that would look like should go here.}
  \item ngAfterContentInit() - Triggered after html is populated. It is called
  once after the first ngDoCheck().
\end{enumerate}
