\section{ Services }
\maketitle{}

First and foremost what is a service in Angular? In Angular, a service is a way
to define business logic in a seperate file, and choose it in our appropriate 
component when it makes sense to do so. Services, even though they are a part 
of the core Angular framework, are by definition created in order to alleviate 
the maintainability and scalability of an application. The bulk of discussion 
around services will be discussed in later chapters. However, it is still a 
part of core Angular, and it is important to be aware of couple things. 

\subsection{ Creating a Service and ProvidedIn: Root }
In order to create a service, navigate to the folder you would like to create 
your service, and run: 
\begin{lstlisting}
ng g service code-box  
\end{lstlisting}

This will create a service that by default includes 
\lstinline{ providedIn: 'root',} It is important to keep in mind, that Angular
provides for services only, the  ability to add to the constructor something 
called \lstinline{ providedIn: 'root',}. In short, it allows for the service 
to injected, without the need to include it in the respective module. It has 
some performance boosts, besides level of convenience. We will get more into 
that in later chapters. 

\subsection{ What Generally Goes in a Service }
A service generally deals with data. This means making data requests, and 
passing that data into our component. Razroo reccomends using Apollo Client
instead of Angular's internal http client, due to the fact that we strongly 
suggest using GraphQL for our application.
