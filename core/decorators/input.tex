\section{ Input }

The Input decorator is one of two integral Angular Decorators, instrumental
for passing into a component, and out of a component into a another one. It's
name sounds like what it does. Similar to an html input, wherein a user inputs
a value, and that's the value that the form now has. Similarly, for an Angular
component, you can put a name on what you would like your input is. Use that
anticipated input value/name within your component. Now, you have the ability to
re-use your component in multiple places, and pass in the data of your choosing
based on the Input value you used.

Here is a great example:

\begin{lstlisting}
\end{lstlisting}
