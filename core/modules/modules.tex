\section{ Modules }
\maketitle{}

Modules are an integral part of Angular. It's interesting, because in some
other languages, modules are a part of the language(OCaml comes to mind). A
module in a language like OCaml, is any code contained within a file. In Angular
a module, is a decorator attached to a class. Angular provides five key/values
to be used with a module:
\begin{lstlisting}
import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
@NgModule({
  imports:      [ BrowserModule ],
  providers:    [ Logger ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  exports:      [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item imports
  \item providers
  \item declarations
  \item exports
  \item bootstrap
\end{enumerate}
\footnote{Note this is not put in alphabetical order. Rather it is put in the
order that the CLI tends to order them. It is this way, because it is the order
in which these items are used within the NgModule declaration.}
