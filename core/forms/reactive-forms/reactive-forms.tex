\section{ Reactive Forms }

Reactive forms are extremely under-rated. As we have discussed before, there are 
many reasons as to why forms are very complicated. Reactive forms are no 
exception to that rule. However, we will discuss them all now. In additionm we
are going to run through all the steps to get from point a to point b, so that
you can constantly reference this, as you create a new reactive form component.

\subsection{ Registering Reactive Forms }

Importing a reactive module, is no different than your regular module, however,
this is the module to use to when importing reactive forms. 

\begin{lstlisting}
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports ...
    ReactiveFormsModule
  ],
})
export class AppModule { }
\end{lstlisting}
