\section{ Forms }

Forms to this day, I think is still one of the most complicated pieces of UI,
you will ever come across. Each input in a form, has a unique piece of 
functionality to it. It can be one of the most fustrating pieces of UI, 
because there is no way to make it truly re-usable as a result. In 
addition, it can be very fustrating to explain to business as to why it is 
taking so long, as a form seems truly simple to make. Over the course of this 
book we will discuss why it is that, that is the case, as well. In addition,
we will discuss ways that we can alleviate the pain of forms. In the meantime 
let's discuss the fundementals of forms. 

Angular offers two ways of handling forms: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reactive Forms 
  \item Template-driven Forms
\end{enumerate}
