\section{ Linting HTML }

Linting html is not as mature as it is with regards to Sass and Javscript in my
opinion. Howvever, that makes sense as html is essentially strucutred xml that
is used within the context of a web app.

That being said, once again, there is no linter that is offered out of the box
through the Angular CLI, or Nrwl Nx either. It is, however, beneficial.
