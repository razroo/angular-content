\section{ Linting HTML }

Linting html is not as mature as it is with regards to Sass and Javscript in my
opinion. Howvever, that makes sense as html is essentially strucutred xml that
is used within the context of a web app.

That being said, once again, there is no linter that is offered out of the box
through the Angular CLI, or Nrwl Nx either. It is, however, beneficial.

Why not use something like Pug(once called Jade) for html templating. The main
benefit of something like Pug I have found is that it tells me where the html
begins and ends. In a complex html element, where there are many levels of
nesting this can be beneficial. However, in a templating engines, there tends to
be many quirks, in particular when it comes to using various frameworks. I have
rarely been on a team where after selling Pug, engineers have been enthusiastic
in using it.
