\section{ Why is an NX Workspace different than an NPM Repo?! }
One of the difficult things when starting with an Nx workspace for the first
time, is comparing it to an NPM repo. One may ask, why is it different than an
actual NPM repo?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All code in the lib can be modified by any one person in the
  ogranization, as opposed to an NPM repo. It is therefore cheaper, and faster.
  \item There is no need to upgrade dependencies. Editing and updating a lib,
  will automatically affect all apps.
  \item It is cheaper to create a lib, as opposed to creating a new NPM package.
  No need to set up a CI/CD, or otherwise.
\end{enumerate}
