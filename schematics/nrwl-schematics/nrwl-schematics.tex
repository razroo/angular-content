\section{ Nrwl Schematics }

We have gone into a deep dive with regards to creating custom schematics.
However, being that we are working with Nrwl schematics, there is a slightly
easier way for us to set up custom schematics within our app. It does tighly
couple our schematics with nrwl schematics, and for that reason I didn't like
it at first. However, after thinking about it, re-factoring the schematics to
be custom schematics wouldn't be the worst thing to happen.

In the previous chapters we created a schematic called the px-schematics. All it
did was generate files. For this task, we decided to go ahead and create our own
custom angular schematics. However, let's say we wanted to create our own
custom schematics, that made use of one of schematics nrwl already has available
for us, then it would definitely make sense to use the Workspace Specific
Schematics.
