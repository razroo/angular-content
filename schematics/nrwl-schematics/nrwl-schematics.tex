\section{ Nrwl Schematics }

We have gone into a deep dive with regards to creating custom schematics.
However, being that we are working with Nrwl schematics, there is a slightly
easier way for us to set up custom schematics within our app. It does tighly
couple our schematics with nrwl schematics, and for that reason I didn't like
it at first. However, after thinking about it, re-factoring the schematics to
be custom schematics wouldn't be the worst thing to happen.
