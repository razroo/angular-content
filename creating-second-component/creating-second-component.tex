\section{ Creating a Second Component }
Creating a second component within your app is a monumentous occasion. It lays
down the groundwork for how you are going to integrate numerous components
together within your app. Let's lay down at a high level what this means with
regards to a Mono Repo, in an enterprise Angular setting:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Lib Folder
  \item Angular CLI Command
  \item Ngrx/nx ngrx considerations
  \item Routing Considerations
  \item Service Considerations
  \item Pipe Considerations
  \item Responsive Considerations
\end{enumerate}

\section{ Angular Pixel Illustrator - Example Use Case }
Let's take the above considerations into our app. The next component we are
going to create is a color picker. It will contain two sub components, a
background color picker, and a pixel color picker, re-used by a singular
component.

It will most definitely be going to into the lib folder. We will be using the
angular cli. We will be creating state, called color. With regards to a route,
we do want to create a generic route, that will switch out from the pixel grid
chooser, over to a a color picker view. We are also going to want a
consideration for mobile as this is a PWA. There aren't any pipes we will be
using.

\section{ Dissecting Business Requirements for Color Picker }
With regards to the color picker. There are three unique aspects of the business
logic:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Color picker
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item RGB
      \item HEX
      \item Convert RGB to HEX and vice versa
      \item Change pixel color, based on color picker value
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Have color bar below pixel picker
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Background Color picker
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item RGB
      \item HEX
      \item Convert RGB to HEX and vice versa.
      \item Change grid background, based on background color.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
