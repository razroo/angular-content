\section{ Material Design }

I was debating writing this chapter. The reason primarily being, that depending
on the size of your company, you might up end writing your own design system. I
completely understand that, and it makes sense if you are a B2C
\footnote{Business to Consumer} enterprise.

However, I truly do not understand why a company using angular 5, or 6, would
not want to use material design. It is the most robust design framework that
exists within open source. In addition, the documentation for Angular components
is next to none.
