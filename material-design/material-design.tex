\section{ Material Design }

I was debating writing this chapter. The reason primarily being, that depending
on the size of your company, you might up end writing your own design system. I
completely understand that, and it makes sense if you are a B2C
\footnote{Business to Consumer} enterprise.

However, I truly do not understand why a company using angular 5, or 6, would
not want to use material design. It is the most robust design framework that
exists within open source. In addition, the documentation for Angular components
is next to none. I personally have been in companies where they had a business
to business application and they decided not to use material design.

I really do not understand the reason for doing this. They could have saved
loads of resources not having to design and implement their own components. It
is out of the vast amount of use cases that I see Material Design being valuable,
that I have decided to go ahead and write about it.
