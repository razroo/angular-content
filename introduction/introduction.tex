\section{Introduction}

The current landscape of UI development is in a very interesting place, for many
reasons. For starters, the mere capacity of web to do many tasks previously
unavailable(Add examples here), is growing by the year. In addition, frameworks
which allow for scalability, DRY development, and consistency is ever going. In
your average web application, it generally includes type checking, unit testing,
integration testing, as well as state management, and observables/effects. These
are all things that 3 years ago were not common place in the enterprise, and it
is only becoming a greater landscape as time goes on.

% Angular in my opinion, having worked with other frameworks such as Elm, Vue,
% React, and Cycle, is in a very unique place.
