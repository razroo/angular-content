\section{ Styling a Component }

Styling a component, of course, is a very complex topic. With styling, as an
architect, there are 5 things that you will have to keep in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Responsive design(even if you have a mobile/tablet app)
  \item Design system
  \item Pre-processor of choice(Scss, Less, PostCss, etc.)
  \item Naming convention of CSS classes
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Material Design(Google)
      \item Fluent Design(Microsoft)
      \item Flat Design(Apple)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Dynamic Classes
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ Responsive Design }
With regards to responsive design, there are a number of frameworks, one can
choose with regards to creating a web app.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Foundation
  \item Bootstrap
  \item Semantic UI
\end{enumerate}

However, the above for a grid system tend to overdue it. Specifically, the
direction many UI web app tend to head, is that it will only be used on Desktop.
For mobile and tablet, there will be a separate Android and IOS app created.
In addition, due to the nature of angulars component architecture, the use of
ready made components, containers for apps, are the only thing which will
actually have specific media queries.

It is strongly suggested that your own super lightweight grid is created.
