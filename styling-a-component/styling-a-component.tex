\section{ Styling a Component }

Styling a component, of course, is a very complex topic. With styling, as an
architect, there are 5 things that you will have to keep in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Responsive design(even if you have a mobile/tablet app)
  \item Pre-processor of choice(Scss, Less, PostCss, etc.)
  \item Naming convention of CSS classes
  \item Design system
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Material Design(Google)
      \item Fluent Design(Microsoft)
      \item Flat Design(Apple)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Dynamic Classes
\end{enumerate}
