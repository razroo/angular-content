  decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and,
  therefore, will be applied} issues rapidly become problemtic, and continue
  to be so.
  \item CSS footprint size becomes excessively large(>250k for flexbox CSS)
  whereas with JS, the module is loaded within every specific module
  \item Changes in layout direction required changes to child flexbox stylings
  \item No built in support for customized media query breakpoints \marginpar{
