\subsection{ Understanding the Issue With CSS Based Flexbox }
\begin{itemize}
  \item CSS specifity \footnote{CSS speicifity, is the means by which browsers
  decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and,
  therefore, will be applied} issues rapidly become problemtic, and continue
  to be so.
  \item CSS footprint size becomes excessively large(>250k for flexbox CSS)
  whereas with JS, the module is loaded within every specific module

  \item No built in support for customized media query breakpoints \marginpar{
  need to look into further about what this means}
