\section{ Data Services }

In an @ngrx/store setting, a very large part of an app's services, will be
directed towards handling data directly. For instance, let's say you have a
GraphQL user query that get's a current user's data. The service would look
something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
getUser(): Observable<User> {
  const user$ = this.apollo.query({ query: GetCurrentUser });

  return from(user$).pipe(pluck('data', 'getCurrentUser'));
}
\end{lstlisting}
