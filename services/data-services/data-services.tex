\section{ Data Services }

In an @ngrx/store setting, a very large part of an app's services, will be
directed towards handling data directly. For instance, let's say you have a
GraphQL user query that get's a current user's data. The service would look
something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

import { Observable, from } from 'rxjs';
import { pluck } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Apollo } from 'apollo-angular';

export class UserService {
  getUser(): Observable<User> {
    const user$ = this.apollo.query({ query: GetCurrentUser });

    return from(user$).pipe(pluck('data', 'getCurrentUser'));
  }
  constructor(private apollo: Apollo) {}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Of course, the amount of queries that need to be used for any data type, is
numerous. It's a rough guess, but odds are that 80\% of services within any
Angular app, will have these sort of services. These services will be used by a
number of effects. In addition, they will contain their own respective unit
tests.
