\section{ Format all the things }

In a Nrwl setting, we have a format npm script that is available to us by default.
It is called:

\begin{verbatim}
  nx format write
\end{verbatim}

This will call, a .prettier file that has been created by the nx workspace
command. Prettier is similar to to the CLI to the extent that there is a lot
that is happening behind the scenes. In short, it will automatically format files
for you, to it's liking. It's like a pro-active linter, that will format code
for you.
